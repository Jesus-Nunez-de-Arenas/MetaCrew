1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 2. The houses are numbered from 1 on the left to 2 on the right.

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical entities in the problem, representing the locations where individuals live. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2

3. **characteristics**: This variable encompasses the unique attributes assigned to each occupant of the houses, which include:
   - **Book Preference**: The type of book each individual prefers, which in this case includes:
     - History (loved by one of the individuals)
     - Mystery (loved by the other individual)
   - **Shoes**: The type of shoes each individual is wearing, which includes:
     - Loafers (worn by one occupant)
     - High Heels (worn by the other occupant)

4. **clues**: This variable consists of the logical statements provided to assist in establishing the relationships and arrangement of individuals within their households. The clues are as follows:
   - Clue 1: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 2: The mystery book reader does not live in the second house.

Analyzing the clues:
- From Clue 1, we can determine that if the person wearing loafers cannot live in House 1, then the loafers must belong to the person in **House 2**.
- From Clue 2, since the mystery book reader does not live in House 2, it follows that the mystery book reader must therefore reside in **House 1**, leading to the conclusion that the occupant of House 1 is the history book buff.

Consequently, the attributes can be paired:
- **House 1**: Occupied by the history book reader who wears high heels.
- **House 2**: Occupied by the mystery book reader who wears loafers.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is **2**.
