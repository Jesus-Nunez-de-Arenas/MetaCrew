To analyze the logic puzzle presented, we can define the following variables:

1. **n**: This represents the number of houses. In this case, n is 4, as there are 4 houses numbered 1 through 4.

2. **houses**: These are the physical locations numbered 1 to 4, where each house has a resident. Each house can be denoted as:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4

3. **characteristics**: The characteristics of the residents are defined through various attributes:
   - **Shoes**: Each person wears different types of shoes: high heels, boots, loafers, and running shoes.
   - **Drinks**: Each person has a favorite beverage: coffee, tea, milk, and root beer.
   - **Devices**: Each person possesses a different device: a radio, a gameboy, a computer, and a television.
   - **Sports**: Each person plays a different sport: basketball, soccer, cricket, and tennis.
   - **Lunch**: Each person ate a different type of lunch: spaghetti, stew, fried rice, and grilled cheese.

4. **clues**: The clues provide relational information to define the placement of residents in the houses:
   - Clue 1: The person who likes milk lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.
   - Clue 2: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - Clue 3: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 4: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who has a computer.
   - Clue 5: The person who has a radio lives in the third house.
   - Clue 6: The basketball player lives in the fourth house.
   - Clue 7: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.
   - Clue 8: The soccer player and the person who has a computer live directly next to each other.
   - Clue 9: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a radio.
   - Clue 10: The person who likes milk lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - Clue 11: The cricketer lives in the third house.
   - Clue 12: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - Clue 13: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.

Based on this information and using the clues, we can methodically deduce the location of each resident and their corresponding attribute. When completing the logical deductions carefully, we find that the person who has a computer resides in House 2.

Thus, the final answer is House 2 as the location of the person with the computer.
