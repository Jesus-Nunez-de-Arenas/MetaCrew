The house where the person who ate fried rice lives is House 1. Here is a breakdown of the features for each house based on the clues provided:  

| House Number | Favorite Color | Lunch         | Shoes         |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 1            | White          | Fried Rice    | Boots         |
| 2            | Green          | Spaghetti     | High Heels    |
| 3            | Red            | Stew          | Running Shoes  |

### Analysis Steps:
1. **Clue 2** - The person in House 1 likes white.
2. **Clue 4** - The person in House 2 likes green.
3. **Clue 3** - The person who ate spaghetti does not live in House 2, leaving either House 1 or House 3.
4. Since House 1 likes white, they cannot eat spaghetti (they must eat either fried rice or stew).
5. **Clue 7** - The person who had stew cannot live in House 2, meaning they must live in House 3.
6. Therefore, House 1 must have had fried rice (the only option left since they can't have spaghetti), leading to spaghetti being eaten by the resident of House 2.
7. According to **Clue 1**, since the person in House 3 has stew, the one in House 2 must be wearing high heels (because House 3 cannot have high heels).
8. **Clue 5** - This logic confirms that the person wearing boots must live in House 1, directly left of House 2 (which has the high heels).

Thus, according to the established characteristics from the clues, the final arrangement is complete, affirming that the person who ate fried rice lives in **House 1**.
