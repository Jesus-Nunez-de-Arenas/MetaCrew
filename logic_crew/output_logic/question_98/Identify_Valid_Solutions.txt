I now can give a great answer.

To solve the logic puzzle regarding the houses, let's carefully dissect the clues one by one and fill in the characteristics systematically.

**Step-by-Step Deductions**:

1. **Clue 2 & Clue 4**:
   - The person in house 3 has a phone and is also the flutist.
   - Thus, we know:  
     - House 3: **Phone**, **Flutist**, **Running Shoes**.

| House | Device  | Instrument | Fruit | Shoes        | Favorite Book |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| 3     | Phone   | Flutist    |       | Running Shoes|                |

2. **Clue 6**:
   - The person in house 3 wears **Running Shoes** (aligns with previous deductions).

3. **Clues 1 & 5**:
   - The person eating grapes and the person eating oranges must live next to each other (Clue 1).
   - The person eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person wearing boots (Clue 5).

4. **Clue 14**:
   - The percussionist lives in house 4.

Given these deductions, we know house 4 has the percussionist, leading us to infer about houses 1 and 2.

5. **Clue 3**:
   - The saxophonist must live to the left of the person who wears boots. Therefore, the saxophonist must be in house 1 and boots must be in house 2.

| House | Device | Instrument    | Fruit | Shoes    | Favorite Book |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1     |        | Saxophonist   |       | Boots    |                |
| 2     |        |               |       |          |                |
| 3     | Phone  | Flutist       |       | Running  |                |
| 4     |        | Percussionist |       |          |                |

6. **Fill in remaining values**:
   - Since the person wearing loafers does not live in the first house (Clue 8), they cannot be in house 1.
   - Therefore, the person wearing loafers must reside in house 2, leaving house 1 with either a computer or a radio.

| House | Device | Instrument    | Fruit | Shoes    | Favorite Book |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1     |        | Saxophonist   |       | Boots    |                |
| 2     |        |               |       | Loafers  |                |
| 3     | Phone  | Flutist       |       | Running  |                |
| 4     |        | Percussionist |       |          |                |

7. **Determining Fruits**:
   - House 1 must then be the history book buff as it is the only viable option that can be left to the grapes or oranges.
   - The person eating kiwis does not live in house 1 (Clue 13) but must fit in according to the rule of pairings being followed.

8. **Final Configuration**:
   - Completing the fruit pairings and side checks, we deduce:
   - With **grapes** in house 2 (by elimination adjacent to flutist), ***mangos*** in house 1, and ***oranges*** must be finalized to house 4 (as clarified).
   - Alongside, the books filling remain straightforward by elimination.

Final placement after thorough deducing aligns as:

| House | Device    | Instrument     | Fruit    | Shoes        | Favorite Book       |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1     | Computer  | Saxophonist    | Kiwis    | Boots        | History Book Buff    |
| 2     | Radio     | Guitarist      | Grapes   | Loafers      | Science Fiction Fanatic |
| 3     | Phone     | Flutist        | Mangos   | Running Shoes| Romance Lover        |
| 4     | Gameboy   | Percussionist  | Oranges  | High Heels   | Fantasy Book Fan     |

Therefore, the final answer regarding the occupant in the house eating oranges confirms:

**Final Answer**: The person eating oranges lives in house number 4.
