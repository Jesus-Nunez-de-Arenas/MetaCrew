To determine the arrangement of the houses and their corresponding characteristics, we will analyze the clues one by one and systematically deduce the positions.

1. **Clue 1**: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a rose bouquet.
   - This implies that the person with the rose bouquet must live in House 1, and thus the root beer lover must live in House 2. 

2. **Clue 2**: The soccer player lives directly left of the mystery book reader.
   - Therefore, since House 1 is to the left of House 2, the soccer player must reside in House 1 and the mystery book reader in House 2.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a gameboy lives somewhere to the left of the mystery book reader.
   - With the soccer player in House 1 and the mystery reader in House 2, this leaves the gameboy holder to be either in House 1 or not present in House 2; however, since the soccer player is in House 1, they must have the gameboy, and the mystery book reader in House 2 must be left with the phone.

We can now assign the characteristics based on the deductions:

- **House 1**:
  - Sport: Soccer
  - Book: Fantasy (since the mystery book reader is in House 2)
  - Drink: Root Beer
  - Device: Gameboy
  - Flowers: Rose bouquet
  
- **House 2**:
  - Sport: Swimming (the other sport)
  - Book: Mystery
  - Drink: Coffee
  - Device: Phone
  - Flowers: Tulips

The final arrangements can be summarized as follows:

1. **House 1**:
   - Book: Fantasy
   - Drink: Root Beer
   - Sport: Soccer
   - Device: Gameboy
   - Flowers: Rose bouquet

2. **House 2**:
   - Book: Mystery
   - Drink: Coffee
   - Sport: Swimming
   - Device: Phone
   - Flowers: Tulips

From this deduction, the person with the rose bouquet lives in **House 1**.

Final findings indicate the number of the house where the person with the rose bouquet lives is **1**.
