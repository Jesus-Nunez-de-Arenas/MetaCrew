The number of the house where the cellist lives is **2**. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning in detail:

1. Based on clues 5 and 8, we know that House 1 has the person who likes green and is eating kiwis. This gives us:
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis, (unknown drink, instrument, device)

2. According to clue 3, the person who drinks water must live to the left of the root beer lover. This means the water drinker must be in House 1 or House 2, and the root beer lover must be in House 2 or House 3. 

3. Clue 6 states that the person who likes blue and the gameboy owner live next to each other. Hence, since House 1 has a known color (green), the options for blue are limited to either House 2 or House 3. 

4. Following clue 4, there is one house between the cellist and the gameboy owner. If we assume the cellist resides in House 2, then the gameboy must be in House 3 or vice versa. 

5. Delivering the final arrangement based on all eliminations and possibilities while paying attention to all the clues:
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis, (Water drinker, unknown instrument, unknown device)
   - House 2: (Unknown color, Unknown fruit, Root beer drinker, likely The Cellist, based on no contradictions)
   - House 3: (Must contain the gameboy user and be adjacent to the blue color lover)

6. Given all deductions, the only suitable placement for the cellist that adheres to all clues implies that the cellist indeed lives in House 2.

Thus, the most complete answer is that the cellist resides in **house 2**.
