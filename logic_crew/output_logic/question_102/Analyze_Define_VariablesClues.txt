1. **n (Number of Houses):** This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4. The houses are numbered from 1 to 4, with house number 1 on the left and house number 4 on the right.

2. **houses:** This variable refers to the four physical entities where individuals live. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1 (left)  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4 (right)  

3. **characteristics:** This variable encompasses the unique attributes assigned to each occupant of the houses. The characteristics include:  
   - **Device Used:** One person has a radio, one has a phone, one has a television, and one has a gameboy.  
   - **Shoes Worn:** One person is wearing boots, one is wearing sandals, one is wearing loafers, and one is wearing running shoes.  

4. **clues:** The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who has a television lives in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 2: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the second house.  
   - Clue 3: The person who has a phone does not live in the second house.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing loafers.
   - Clue 5: There are two houses between where the person who has a radio lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.  

Analyzing the clues step by step:  
- From Clue 1, we know that the television is in House 4.  
- Clue 2 tells us that loafers are in House 2.  
- Clue 3 indicates that the phone cannot be in House 2, meaning the phone is either in House 1 or House 3 or House 4 (but since 4 has the TV, it must be 1 or 3).  
- Clue 4 states that boots must be to the left of the loafers in House 2. Hence, boots must be in House 1 (the only house left of House 2).  
- From this, House 1 has boots, and since House 2 has loafers, House 3 must contain the phone (since it cannot be in 2), leaving House 4 for the television.

Now, analyzing Clue 5:  
- There are two houses between the person with a radio and the person with sandals. Since House 1 has boots, and House 2 has loafers, the only arrangement that works is if House 3 has the radio, meaning House 1 must have sandals. So, we conclude:
    - House 1: Boots & Sandals
    - House 2: Loafers
    - House 3: Radio & Phone
    - House 4: Television

Finalizing, the person with the gameboy must be in House 1 since all other devices are accounted for. Therefore, the person who has the gameboy lives in house number **3**.
