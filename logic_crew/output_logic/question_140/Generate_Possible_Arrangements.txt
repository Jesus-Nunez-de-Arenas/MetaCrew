To solve the arrangement of the houses and their corresponding characteristics, I analyzed the clues provided systematically:

Based on the clues:
1. The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.
2. The science fiction book fanatic lives in the first house.

From Clue 2:
- The science fiction book fanatic must live in House 1.

From Clue 1:
- This means that since the coffee drinker must live left of the person wearing sandals and House 1 is on the left, the person in House 1 must be the coffee drinker.

Therefore, we have:
- House 1: Coffee drinker, Science Fiction book fanatic.

This implies:
- The person in House 2, being to the right, must be drinking water and wearing sandals (since the coffee drinker is already in House 1).

Now we can summarize the findings:

1. House 1 characteristics:
   - Favorite Drink: Coffee
   - Type of Shoes: Loafers (because the person in House 2 is wearing sandals)
   - Favorite Book Genre: Science Fiction

2. House 2 characteristics:
   - Favorite Drink: Water
   - Type of Shoes: Sandals
   - Favorite Book Genre: Romance (the only genre left for House 2).

Thus, the complete arrangement of the houses is:

| House Number | Favorite Drink | Type of Shoes | Favorite Book Genre       |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| 1            | Coffee         | Loafers        | Science Fiction            |
| 2            | Water          | Sandals        | Romance                   |

From this, it can be concluded that the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is House 2. Therefore, the answer is:

2
