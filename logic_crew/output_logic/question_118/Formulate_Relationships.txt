The arrangement of the houses and their respective characteristics is as follows:

| House Number | Flowers    | Musical Instrument | Car         |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|-------------|
| House 1      | Daffodils  | Saxophonist        | Sedan       |
| House 2      | Lilies     | Flutist            | Convertible  |

Based on the clues:
- The person who owns a sedan (House 1) is to the left of the person with the bouquet of lilies (House 2).
- The flutist does not live in House 1, which means the flutist must be in House 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives is House 2.
