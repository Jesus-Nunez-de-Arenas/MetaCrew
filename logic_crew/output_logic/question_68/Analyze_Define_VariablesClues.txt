1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4. The houses are numbered from 1 to 4, with house number 1 on the left and house number 4 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 4 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Pets**: The types of pets owned by the residents are:
     - Cat lover
     - Fish enthusiast
     - Horse owner
     - Dog owner
   - **Car type**: The types of cars owned by the residents are:
     - Minivan
     - Truck
     - Sedan
     - SUV

4. **clues**: The problem provides several clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who drives a minivan lives somewhere to the right of the fish enthusiast.
   - Clue 2: There are two houses between where the person who drives a truck lives and where the dog owner lives.
   - Clue 3: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.
   - Clue 4: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - Clue 5: The cat lover does not live in the second house.

Based on the provided clues, we can analyze and deduce the relationships:

- From Clue 3, we know that since the truck driver is directly to the left of the sedan owner, the arrangements limit the truck and sedan to configurations of Houses 1-2 or 2-3; House 4 cannot have the truck due to the total number of houses.
- From Clue 2, "two houses between the dog owner and the truck driver" indicates the only viable configuration is: Truck in House 1 and dog owner in House 4.
- Applying Clue 4 (the fish enthusiast lives left of the dog owner), it means the fish enthusiast must be in House 3.
- Clue 1 states the minivan driver must be to the right of the fish enthusiast, indicating that the minivan driver must be in House 4.
- Finally, from Clue 5 (the cat lover does not live in House 2), and noting that the dog owner cannot be the fish enthusiast or truck driver, we conclude that:
   - House 1 has the truck driver.
   - House 2 must be the sedan driver (house 4 plants dog owner).
   - House 3 has the fish enthusiast. 
   - House 4 includes the dog owner.

Thus, the arrangements come together as follows:
- House 1: Truck Driver (unknown)
- House 2: Sedan Driver (unknown)
- House 3: Fish Enthusiast (unknown)
- House 4: Dog Owner (unknown)

Upon further deduction:
- The Horse Owner must then equate to the sedan driver, hence Animal owners distribute as:
   - House 1: Truck Driver (Horse Owner)
   - House 2: Sedan Driver (Cat Lover)
   - House 3: Fish Enthusiast
   - House 4: Dog Owner

In conclusion, through elimination and deduction, we ascertain that the dog owner resides in House number **4**.
