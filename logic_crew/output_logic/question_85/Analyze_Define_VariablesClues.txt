4. **clue(s)**: This variable consists of the logical statement provided to aid in establishing the relationships between the individuals and their attributes. The clues are:
   - Clue 1: The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.

Analyzing the clues:
- From Clue 1, since the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic, and there are only two houses, it implies that the science fiction book fanatic must live in **House 1** and the person who ate fried rice must live in **House 2**.

Consequently, we can conclude:

- **House 2**: Fried Rice Eater (who is the History Book Buff)

Thus, the number of the house where the science fiction book fanatic lives is **1**.
