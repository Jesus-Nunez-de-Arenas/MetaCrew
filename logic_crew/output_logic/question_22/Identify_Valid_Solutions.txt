The bird keeper lives in House 4, based on the deductions from the clues provided:
1. The baseball player is confirmed to live in House 2 (Clue 3).
2. The basketball player must be in House 3 because he cannot be in House 1 (Clue 1) and must be to the left of the swimmer (so the swimmer is in House 4).
3. The dog owner lives in House 3 (since the fish enthusiast must be to the right of the dog owner).
4. The tennis player occupies House 1 as they are left of the cat lover (who is in House 2).
5. The bird keeper cannot be in House 1 or House 3 due to clues provided (Clues 5 and 7), so they must be in House 4.
Thus, summarizing:  
- House 1: Tennis Player with a Dog  
- House 2: Baseball Player with a Cat  
- House 3: Basketball Player with a Fish  
- House 4: Swimmer with a Bird  
The bird keeper is correctly placed in House 4.
