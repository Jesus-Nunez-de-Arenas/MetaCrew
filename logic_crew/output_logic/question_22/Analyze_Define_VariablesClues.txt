1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is specified as 4. It indicates that there are four distinct living spaces, numbered from 1 (leftmost) to 4 (rightmost).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical entities where individuals reside. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4

3. **characteristics**: This variable includes the distinct attributes of each person living in the houses:
   - **Sport**: Each person engages in a different sport. The sports involved are swimming, tennis, baseball, and basketball.
   - **Pets**: Each person has a unique type of pet: one is a bird keeper, one is a fish enthusiast, one is a dog owner, and one is a cat lover.

4. **clues**: These are the logical statements that help deduce the arrangement and characteristics of the residents. The clues are:
   - Clue 1: The basketball player does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 2: The basketball player lives somewhere to the left of the swimmer.
   - Clue 3: The baseball player lives in the second house.
   - Clue 4: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - Clue 5: The bird keeper does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 6: The tennis player lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - Clue 7: The bird keeper does not live in the third house.

Analyzing the clues step by step:
- From Clue 3, the baseball player is in House 2.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 2, since the basketball player is not in House 1 and is to the left of the swimmer, it could only be in House 2 (which we know is filled) or House 3.
- Since the basketball player cannot be in House 1, they must be in House 3, meaning the swimmer must be in House 4.
- Clue 4 says the fish enthusiast is to the right of the dog owner. The only position available that satisfies this is House 4 for the fish enthusiast and House 3 for the dog owner.
- Clue 6 indicates that the tennis player must be in House 1 (the only option left) and the cat lover will be in House 2.
- Finally, the bird keeper cannot be in House 1 (Clue 5) or House 3 (Clue 7), thus they must live in House 4.

Hence, the deduced inhabitants are:
- House 1: Tennis Player with a Dog
- House 2: Baseball Player with a Cat
- House 3: Basketball Player with a Fish
- House 4: Swimmer with a Bird 

Now identifying the Bird Keeper's house number, we see the Bird Keeper lives in House 4.

Thus, the final answer is: **4**.
