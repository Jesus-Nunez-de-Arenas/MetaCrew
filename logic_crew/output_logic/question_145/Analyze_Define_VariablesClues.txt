1. Variables:
   - **n**: Represents the total number of houses, which is 3 in this scenario.
   - **houses**: The houses are numbered sequentially from 1 to 3, located in a row from left to right.
   - **characteristics**: Each person living in the houses has two distinct attributes:
     - Lunch eaten: 
       - Fried rice
       - Spaghetti
       - Grilled cheese
     - Book preference:
       - Science fiction fanatic
       - Fantasy book enthusiast
       - Mystery book reader
      
2. Clues provided:
   - **Clue 1**: The person who ate spaghetti lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice. 
     - This establishes that the individual who had spaghetti cannot live in the same house as or to the right of the fried rice eater.
   
   - **Clue 2**: The person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
     - This indicates that the science fiction book fanatic must reside in a house that is numerically lower than the house of the fried rice eater.
   
   - **Clue 3**: The person who ate fried rice lives in the second house.
     - This is a definite placement that confirms the house number of the fried rice eater.
   
   - **Clue 4**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.
     - Since fried rice is already assigned to the second house, this clue indicates that the fried rice eater is not the fantasy book enthusiast.

Through logical deduction based on the clues, we can determine placements as follows:
- House 2 has the person who ate fried rice and is not the fantasy book enthusiast, meaning they must prefer either science fiction or mystery. 
- Since the fried rice eater lives to the right of the science fiction fanatic, the only possible arrangement is:
  - House 1: Science Fiction fanatic + Spaghetti
  - House 2: Fried Rice + Fantasy Enthusiast
  - House 3: Grilled Cheese + Mystery Reader

We conclude that the person who ate grilled cheese resides in house number 3.

Thus the house number where the person who ate grilled cheese lives is:

House number: 3
