1. `n` - This variable represents the total number of houses available in the scenario, which is 3. 
   
2. `houses` - The houses are numbered 1, 2, and 3, where house 1 is on the leftmost side, and house 3 is on the rightmost side. Each house houses one distinct person with unique characteristics.
