| 4            | Running Shoes   | Spaghetti      | Root Beer       |

- The tea drinker is confirmed in House 3.
- The person who had stew must be to the left of the spaghetti eater, which places them in House 2.
- The person in House 4 is wearing running shoes and loves root beer.

Thus, the person who is wearing running shoes lives in House **4**.
