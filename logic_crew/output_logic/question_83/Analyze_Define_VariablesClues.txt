1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4. The houses are numbered from 1 (left) to 4 (right).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical locations where individuals live. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  

3. **characteristics**: Each person living in the houses has various attributes categorized as follows:

   - **Lunch**: The meals eaten by the individuals are stew, grilled cheese, spaghetti, and fried rice.  
   - **Favorite Drink**: The drinks preferred by the individuals are tea, milk, water, and root beer.  

4. **clues**: The logical statements provided are essential in determining the relationships and arrangement of individuals in their respective households. The clues are as follows:
   - Clue 1: The tea drinker lives in the third house.
   - Clue 2: The person who had stew lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Clue 3: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.
   - Clue 4: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - Clue 5: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the left of the person who had stew.
   - Clue 6: The person who is wearing high heels and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - Clue 7: The person who ate grilled cheese does not live in the first house.

Using the clues, we can derive the following conclusions:
1. From Clue 1, the tea drinker must be in House 3.
2. Clue 7 indicates the person who ate grilled cheese cannot be in House 1, therefore they must be in House 2 or House 4.
3. Clue 2 states that the stew eater has to be left of the spaghetti eater, which means that they cannot be in House 4.
4. Thus, if the stew is in House 1, spaghetti must be in House 2.
5. Following these patterns, the shoes and drinks can also be derived logically.

- After solving, we can determine:
  - House 1: wears boots, has lunch of grilled cheese, drinks milk.
  - House 2: wears sandals, has lunch of stew, drinks tea.
  - House 3: wears high heels, has lunch of fried rice, drinks water.
  - House 4: wears running shoes, has lunch of spaghetti, drinks root beer.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing running shoes lives is **4**.
