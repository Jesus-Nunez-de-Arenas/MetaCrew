Based on the clues provided, we can make the following deductions:

1. From Clue 1, we know that the person who likes red lives in House 1. Therefore, House 1's favorite color is red.
  
2. Clue 7 states that the person who is eating grapes also lives in House 1. Thus, House 1 has a resident who likes red and is eating grapes.

3. Considering Clue 2, the person who had pizza must live left of the person who has a computer. This implies that the computer could either be in House 2 or 3.

4. From Clue 3, the person who ate grilled cheese and the one who likes white must live next to each other. Thus, if House 1 has red and grapes, then we can't have white or grilled cheese in House 1, meaning House 1's neighbor (House 2) could have either white or grilled cheese.

5. Clue 4 indicates that there's one house between the person with a radio and the person with a computer. This means that at least one house must be empty between them.

6. Considering Clue 5, the soccer player lives somewhere to the right of the person eating apples, indicating apples are not in House 3.

7. From Clue 6, the person who ate grilled cheese is directly left of the cricketer. For this to hold, if we assume House 2 has grilled cheese and House 3 the cricketer, House 2 must then have white to satisfy the adjacent condition from Clue 3.

By deducing through the clues, we confirm that:
- House 1 has the red-loving individual who eats grapes.
- House 2 likely has the person with white who eats grilled cheese.
- House 3 will contain the individual with a computer who doesn't eat pizza but must therefore eat either stew or left-over (not apple from House 1).

Consolidating all findings:
- House 1: Red, Grapes, (lunch eaten unaccounted), (sport unaccounted), (device unaccounted)
- House 2: White, Grilled Cheese, (must accommodate for the cricketer). 
- House 3: (implied colors must be arranged accordingly).

Final deductions reaffirm the resident of House 1 with the characteristics confirmed living there is the individual who likes red.

So, the number of the house where the person who likes red lives is House 1.

Thus, the answer is choice: 1
