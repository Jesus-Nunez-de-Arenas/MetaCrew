1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 2. The houses are numbered from 1 to 2, with house number 1 on the left and house number 2 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 2 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Shoes**: One person is wearing sandals and the other is wearing boots.  
   - **Book preference**: One person likes mystery books, and the other is a history book buff.  
   - **Car type**: One person drives a convertible, and the other drives a truck.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - **Clue 1**: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.  
   - **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.  

**Analyzing the clues**:

- From Clue 2, since the person wearing boots does not live in House 1, this implies that the individual with boots must reside in House 2. Consequently, the individual in House 1 must be the one wearing sandals.  

- Referring to Clue 1, which states the person driving a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff, we can deduce that if the person in House 1 (who is wearing sandals) drives a convertible, then the person in House 2 (wearing boots) must be the history book buff. This all fits the clues provided. Furthermore, this arrangement indicates that the person in House 1 must be the mystery book reader and drives a convertible, while the person in House 2 drives a truck.

**Summary of characteristics per house**:
- **House 1**:  
  - Shoes: Sandals  
  - Book Preference: Mystery  
  - Car Type: Convertible  

- **House 2**:  
  - Shoes: Boots  
  - Book Preference: History  
  - Car Type: Truck  

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **1**.
