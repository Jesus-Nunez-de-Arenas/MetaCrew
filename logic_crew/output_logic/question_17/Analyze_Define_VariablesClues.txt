1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the row. In this case, n = 4.

2. **houses**: This refers to the individual locations where people live, numbered from 1 to 4, where 1 is the leftmost house and 4 is the rightmost. Each house can be assigned a unique combination of characteristics based on given clues.

3. **characteristics**: This includes multiple categories relevant to each occupant of the houses, specifically: 
   - **pets**: Each person has a different pet type: bird keeper, fish enthusiast, horse owner, and cat lover.
   - **drinks**: Each person has a distinct favorite drink: tea, root beer, water, and milk.
   - **fruits**: Each person is consuming a different type of fruit: oranges, mangos, apples, and kiwis.
   - **musical instruments**: Each person plays a different musical instrument: violin, flute, guitar, and cello.

4. **clues**: These are the conditional statements provided which help narrow down the arrangement of characteristics among the houses:
   - Clue 1: The fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist.
   - Clue 2: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist.
   - Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who is eating apples lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.
   - Clue 4: The person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other.
   - Clue 5: The flutist lives in the first house.
   - Clue 6: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 7: The person who likes milk does not live in the third house.
   - Clue 8: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
   - Clue 9: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.
   - Clue 10: The fish enthusiast and the person who owns horses live directly next to each other.
   - Clue 11: The person who is eating oranges does not live in the second house.
   - Clue 12: The person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
   - Clue 13: The cat lover lives in the first house.

Thus, the main variables that need to be analyzed for their respective attributes based on the logic puzzle are the houses (1 to 4), the occupants of each house along with their unique combination of characteristics (pets, drinks, fruits, and musical instruments), and the clues that guide the arrangement of these characteristics in a structured manner. 

Based on the above analysis, the person who is eating kiwis is definitively located in house 1.

House number of the person who is eating kiwis: **1**
