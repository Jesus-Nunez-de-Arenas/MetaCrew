I now can give a great answer. 

To solve this logic puzzle, we need to analyze the clues step-by-step, determining the correct arrangement of house occupants and their respective characteristics. 

1. **Starting Point**: 
   - From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house.
   - From Clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis also lives in the first house.
   - From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house. Therefore, the first house must have the flutist who is a cat lover and is also eating kiwis.

   **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis

2. **Filling Houses Based on Clue**:
   - From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis, implying they must be in house 2, 3, or 4 since kiwis are in house 1.
   - From Clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. Since the only water drinker can only be in house 2 due to previously established clues, if house 2 has water, house 3 must have milk. 

   **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis  
   **House 2**: Water  
   **House 3**: Milk  

3. **Further Deductions**:
   - In Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in house 1, which we have established.
   - Given Clue 11, the person who is eating oranges cannot be in house 2, indicating they must be in house 3.

4. **Locating Other Characteristics**:
   - From Clue 3, there is one house between the person eating apples and the person eating oranges. If oranges are in house 3, apples must be in house 1. Since house 1 already has kiwis, the only viable option is for the person who eats apples to be in house 2 (making it impossible). 

   Given that oranges take house 3, and considering that the only other person left is in house 4, who can only be a fish enthusiast.

5. **Finalizing Assignments**:
   - Fish Enthusiast left of Cellist (Clue 1): Therefore, house 3 must have a cellist and can only be adjacent to house 2. This slot fills:
      - **House 4**: Guitarist
      - **House 3**: Cellist
      - **House 2**: Water with Apples
      - **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis

Finally, we're left determining that the person who is eating kiwis indeed is:

**Final Answer**: 1
