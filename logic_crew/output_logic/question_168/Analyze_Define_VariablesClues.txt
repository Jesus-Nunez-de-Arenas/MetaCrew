1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses, which is 4 in this scenario; they are numbered sequentially from House 1 (left) to House 4 (right).

2. **houses**: The distinct locations where individuals reside are denoted by:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4

3. **characteristics**: Each person living in these houses has unique attributes that can be classified into the following categories:
   - **fruit**: The types of fruit being eaten include mangos, kiwis, oranges, and bananas.
   - **pets**: The types of pets owned by the individuals consist of horses, dogs, birds, and cats.

4. **clues**: The logical statements provided to assist in deducing the characteristics associated with each house are as follows:
   - Clue 1: The person who is eating mangos lives in the first house.
   - Clue 2: The person who owns horses does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 3: The bird keeper and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating a banana does not live in the third house.
   - Clue 5: The person who owns horses does not live in the second house.
   - Clue 6: The person who is eating a banana lives directly left of the dog owner.

Using logical deduction based on the clues:
1. From Clue 1, we know that the person in House 1 is eating mangos.
2. Clue 2 tells us that the horse owner cannot be in House 1, hence they could only be in House 3 or 4.
3. Clue 3 indicates that the bird keeper and the kiwi eater must be adjacent, which further restricts assignments.
4. Clue 4 rules out House 3 for the banana eater.
5. Clue 5 confirms that the horse owner is not in House 2, so they must be in House 4, meaning House 3 must have the dog owner since a pet is assigned to each house.
6. Thus, the only logical house assignments can be deduced, ultimately leading us to determine that the bird keeper lives in House 2.

Therefore, after analyzing the clues, the house number where the bird keeper resides is **2**.
