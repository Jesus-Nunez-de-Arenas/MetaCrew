I now can give a great answer.

To solve the puzzle, I'll structure the relationships between the houses based on the characteristics and the clues provided.

### Clues Analysis:
1. **Clue 1**: The flutist lives in the second house.  
   - House 2: Flutist

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the guitarist.  
   - This means the vase of tulips must be in House 1 or House 2 (but House 2 has the flutist). Therefore, it must be in House 1.

3. **Clue 3**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.  
   - This clue sets an order between these two flower arrangements.

4. **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the flutist lives and where the pianist lives.  
   - Since the flutist is in House 2, the pianist must be in House 4 (as House 1 is already taken by the tulips).

### Deductions:
- Since House 1 has the vase of tulips, and House 2 has the flutist, we know House 3 and 4 are left for the guitarist and the other flowers.
- To meet the requirements of clue 3:
    - House 3 must have the carnations arrangement (to satisfy clue 3 with House 4 having the lilies, which fits the order).
  
- This leaves House 4 to have the bouquet of lilies and the pianist.

### Filling out the table based on the deductions:

| House Number | Flowers               | Instrument    |
|--------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| 1            | Tulips                | Percussionist |
| 2            | (unknown)             | Flutist       |
| 3            | Carnations            | Guitarist     |
| 4            | Lilies                | Pianist       |

### Final Confirmation:
- The flutist is in House 2.
- The carnations in House 3 and lilies in House 4 correct the left positioning.
- The tulips in House 1 is left of the guitarist who is in House 3 satisfying clue 2.
- The pianist is in House 4, confirming the separation from the flutist in House 2.

### Final Answer
The number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is **1**.
