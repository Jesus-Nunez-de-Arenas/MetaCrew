| House Number | Resident Characteristics                       |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1            | Golfer                                        |
| 2            | Swimmer, Mystery Book Reader                  |
| 3            | Basketball Player, Romance Book Lover         |
| 4            | History Book Buff                             |

Based on the logical deductions made from the clues provided:
- The golfer resides in House 1.
- The swimmer, who must live left of the romance book lover, is placed in House 2.
- The romance book lover must then occupy House 3.
- Consequently, the history book buff is necessarily in House 4 to fit with the clues.
- The basketball player must be in House 3, as all other options are filled.

Thus, the house number where the basketball player lives is **3**.
