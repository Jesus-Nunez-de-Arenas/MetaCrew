- From the clues, we will break down the information step by step:

1. **Clue 5** states: The golfer lives in the first house.
   - **House 1**: Golfer

2. **Clue 2** states: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house. This means the basketball player can live in House 1, 2, or 3.

3. **Clue 4** states: The swimmer does not live in the third house. Thus, the swimmer can be in House 1, 2, or 4. Since House 1 is occupied by the golfer, the swimmer must be in House 2 or 4.

4. **Clue 1** states: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover. This means:
   - If the swimmer is in House 2, then the romance book lover must be in House 3. 
   - If the swimmer were in House 4, there wouldn't be a house to the right for the romance book lover, so the swimmer has to be in House 2.

5. Thus we have:
   - **House 1**: Golfer
   - **House 2**: Swimmer
   - **House 3**: Romance book lover

6. Now applying **Clue 3**: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff. Since we have determined that House 3 is the romance book lover (not fitting these criteria), House 4 must be occupied by the history book buff, making House 3 the mystery book reader.

Final arrangement would be:
- **House 1**: Golfer
- **House 2**: Swimmer, this is directly before:
- **House 3**: Mystery book reader
- **House 4**: History book buff (no relationship here to the romance book lover). 

Since Clue 2 specifies that the basketball player cannot be in House 4 and only House 3 is left, the basketball player must be in **House 4**.

Thus, the house where the basketball player resides is **3**.

Therefore, the final structured answer based on the inferences is that the basketball player lives in **House 3**.
