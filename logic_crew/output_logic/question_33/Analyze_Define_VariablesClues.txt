1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 5. The houses are numbered from 1 to 5, with house number 1 on the left and house number 5 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 5 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  
   - House 5  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Shoes**: One person is wearing sandals, one is wearing running shoes, one is wearing loafers, one is wearing boots, and one is wearing high heels.  
   - **Car type**: One drives a minivan, one owns an SUV, one drives a truck, one drives a convertible, and one owns a sedan.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - **Clue 1**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.  
   - **Clue 2**: The person who owns a sedan does not live in the third house.  
   - **Clue 3**: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the person who is wearing high heels.  
   - **Clue 4**: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.  
   - **Clue 5**: The person who is wearing running shoes and the person who is wearing boots live directly next to each other.  
   - **Clue 6**: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.  

**Analyzing the clues:**

- From Clue 1, we know the person wearing running shoes is in House 1.  
- Therefore, House 1: Running Shoes.  

- From Clue 6, the occupant of House 4 owns an SUV.  

- According to Clue 5, since the person in House 1 (running shoes) and the person in House 2 (unknown shoes) are direct neighbors, we must analyze further. If House 1 has running shoes, the boots must be in House 2.

- Examining Clue 3, if the minivan is directly left of the person wearing high heels, that suggests the high heels cannot be in House 1 or House 2 (since House 1 has running shoes and House 2 has boots). Thus, high heels must be in House 3, indicating that minivan must be in House 2.

- Following that logic through Clue 4, since sandals must come directly left of the convertible, sandals cannot be in House 3 (high heels) or House 4 (SUV). Therefore, sandals must be in House 5 and convertible must be in House 4.

- Using Clue 2, the sedan cannot be in House 3, hence, it must reside in House 3, and the truck must then be in House 4.

**Summary of characteristics per house**:
- **House 1**:  
  - Shoes: Running Shoes  
  - Car Type: Truck  

- **House 2**:  
  - Shoes: Boots  
  - Car Type: Minivan  

- **House 3**:  
  - Shoes: Loafers  
  - Car Type: Sedan  

- **House 4**:  
  - Shoes: High Heels  
  - Car Type: SUV  

- **House 5**:  
  - Shoes: Sandals  
  - Car Type: Convertible  

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing running shoes lives is **1**.
