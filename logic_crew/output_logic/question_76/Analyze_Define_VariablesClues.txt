1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 5. The houses are numbered from 1 to 5, with house number 1 on the left and house number 5 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 5 houses in total, each inhabited by one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  
   - House 5  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Pets**: Each person has a different type of pet: one is a dog owner, one is a cat lover, one is a fish enthusiast, one owns horses, and one is a bird keeper.  
   - **Sports**: Each person plays a different sport: one is a basketball player, one is a cricketer, one is a golfer, one is a tennis player, and one is a baseball player.  
   - **Shoes**: Each person is wearing different kinds of shoes: one is wearing high heels, one is wearing boots, one is wearing running shoes, one is wearing sandals, and one is wearing loafers.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The cricketer lives in the second house.  
   - Clue 2: The golfer lives in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 3: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fifth house.  
   - Clue 5: The fish enthusiast lives in the second house.  
   - Clue 6: The bird keeper lives in the first house.  
   - Clue 7: The person who is wearing loafers and the cricketer live directly next to each other.  
   - Clue 8: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is wearing sandals lives.  
   - Clue 9: The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 10: The baseball player lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing sandals.  
   - Clue 11: The cat lover lives somewhere to the right of the golfer.  
   - Clue 12: There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who is wearing boots lives.  

Through careful analysis and deduction based on these clues, we determine the arrangement:

1. The first house has the bird keeper (Clue 6).
2. The second house has the cricketer and the fish enthusiast (Clue 1 and Clue 5).
3. The golfer is in the fourth house (Clue 2).
4. The tennis player must then be in the third house (according to Clue 3 where he is left of the sandals).
5. The baseball player is in the fifth house (Clue 10) since he is to the right of the sandals, which has to be in the third house as well based on earlier deductions.

Now from the clues about the footwear: 
- The person with loafers lives next to the cricketer in the second house (Clue 7).
- The bird keeper must then have high heels (due to the position constraints), leaving sandals to the third house (tennis player).

Final arrangement based on analysis:
- House 1: Bird Keeper (High Heels)
- House 2: Cricketer (Loafers, Fish Enthusiast)
- House 3: Tennis Player (Sandals)
- House 4: Golfer (Boots)
- House 5: Baseball Player (Running Shoes)

This means the dog owner must then fit the unassigned characteristics, concluding he must be in House 3 based on his placement behind the birdkeeper and cat lover.

Thus, the deduced inhabitants of House 3 were determined to be the dog owner. 

The conclusion is that the number of the house where the dog owner lives is House **3**.
