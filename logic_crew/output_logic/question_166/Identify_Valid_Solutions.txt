To solve the puzzle, we will analyze the clues and establish the relationships between the houses, their respective pets, and flower arrangements:

**Houses**: 1, 2, 3  
**Characteristics**:
- Pets: Dog Owner, Cat Lover, Bird Keeper
- Flowers: Rose Bouquet, Vase of Tulips, Carnations Arrangement

**Clue Analysis**:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.  
   This indicates that the bird keeper cannot be in House 3 (as there would be no house on the right). Therefore, the bird keeper must occupy either House 1 or House 2. This also places the carnations arrangement in either House 2 or House 3, respectively.

2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.  
   Consequently, the dog owner can either be in House 1 or House 3.

3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.  
   If the dog owner is in House 1, the tulips can only be in House 2 or House 3. If the dog owner were in House 3, this would contradict the clue since there would be no house to the right for the tulips.

**Understanding House Assignments**:
- Since the dog owner cannot reside in House 2, they must be assigned to House 1.
- This places the bird keeper in House 2 and, because the carnations arrangement must be to the right of the bird keeper, the carnations must be assigned to House 3. 
- Following clue 3, since the tulips must be to the right of the dog owner (in House 1), the only available spot left for tulips is House 2. Consequently, we conclude the assignments as follows:
  - House 1: Dog Owner, Rose Bouquet
  - House 2: Bird Keeper, Vase of Tulips
  - House 3: Cat Lover, Carnations

**Final Relationships**:
| House Number | Pet        | Flower          |
|--------------|------------|------------------|
| 1            | Dog Owner  | Rose Bouquet     |
| 2            | Bird Keeper | Vase of Tulips  |
| 3            | Cat Lover  | Carnations       |

**Final Answer**:
The number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is: 2.
