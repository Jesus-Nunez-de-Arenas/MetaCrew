1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 3. The houses are numbered from 1 on the left to 3 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 3 houses in total, each with one resident possessing unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Flowers**: Each resident has different kinds of flowers in their foyer. The options are:
     - Lilies
     - Carnations
     - Daffodils
   - **Favorite Color**: Each resident has a favorite color. The options are:
     - Green
     - Blue
     - Yellow
   - **Footwear/Shoes**: Each resident is wearing different types of shoes. The options are:
     - Boots
     - Loafers
     - High Heels
   - **Book Preferences**: Each resident likes a different kind of book. The options are:
     - Romance
     - History
     - Science Fiction

4. **clues**: The following clues are provided to establish relationships and positions among the characteristics:
   - **Clue 1**: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing high heels.
   - **Clue 2**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the first house.
   - **Clue 3**: The history book buff lives in the second house.
   - **Clue 4**: The person who likes yellow does not live in the third house.
   - **Clue 5**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic.
   - **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing loafers lives in the third house.
   - **Clue 7**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives in the second house.
   - **Clue 8**: The person who is wearing boots and the person who likes yellow live directly next to each other.

Through analyzing these clues, we deduce the arrangement of the individuals:

- From **Clue 3**, the history book buff must be in House 2.
- **Clue 7** states the person with daffodils is also in House 2.
- Therefore, House 2 must have the person who has daffodils and is the history book buff.
- **Clue 6** confirms that House 3 has the person wearing loafers.
- **Clue 1** states that the blue lover must be to the right of someone wearing high heels. Since high heels must therefore be in House 1, we can assert:
  - House 1: High Heels, ... (not blue, not yellow) 
  - House 2: History book buff, Daffodils
  - House 3: Loafers, not yellow
  
Since the person in House 1 wears high heels and cannot have blue or yellow (thus must be green), it follows that:
- House 1: High Heels, Green
- House 2: History book buff, Daffodils
- House 3: Must be Yellow + Loafers

The only remaining flower arrangement is lilies which must then occupy House 3 with the blue lover:

- House 1: High Heels, Green
- House 2: History book buff, Daffodils, (possibly yellow)
- House 3: Boots, Blue

With these arrangements confirmed, we conclude that:
- The person who likes green lives in House **1**.

So, the number of the house where the person who likes green lives is **1**.
