After analyzing all the clues provided, I deduced the arrangements for the houses as follows:  

1. The person who lives in house 1 likes blue, is a guitarist, and has a gameboy.  
2. The person who lives in house 2 likes yellow, is a cellist, and has a radio.  
3. The person who lives in house 3 likes green, is a percussionist, and has a television.  
4. The person who lives in house 4 likes white, is a saxophonist, and has a computer.  
5. The person who lives in house 5 likes red, is a violinist, and has a phone.  

Thus, upon careful analysis, the saxophonist lives in house number 4.
