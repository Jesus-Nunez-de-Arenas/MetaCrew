I now can give a great answer.

To solve the puzzle systematically, let's analyze the clues one by one to determine the characteristics of each house and figure out where the fish enthusiast lives:

1. **House Information**: We have 4 houses numbered 1 to 4 from left to right.
2. **Characteristics**: 
   - **Pets**: Horses, Dogs, Cats, Fish
   - **Flowers**: Tulips, Lilies, Carnations, Daffodils

3. **Clue Breakdown**:
   - **Clue 1**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - **Clue 2**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives.
   - **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - **Clue 5**: The cat lover lives in the first house.

4. **Initial Assignments**:
   - From **Clue 5**, we conclude:
     - House 1: Cat lover.

5. **Analyzing Remaining Houses**:
   - Now, since the cat lover is in House 1, we examine the other clues:
   - Using **Clue 1**, if House 1 has the cat lover, then House 2 must be either the tulips owner or the dog owner.
   - **Clue 2** states the daffodil owner does not live in House 2, thus limiting the tulips to House 2.

6. **Resolving the Arrangement**:
   - If House 2 has the tulips, then House 3 must be the dog owner (as per **Clue 1**).
   - Given that House 3 cannot be daffodil owner (as per **Clue 2**), it must follow:
     - **House 1**: Cat Lover
     - **House 2**: Tulips
     - **House 3**: Dog Owner
     - **House 4**: Therefore must be the daffodil owner or horse owner.

7. **Configure the Horses and Lilies**:
   - Given **Clue 3** indicates a separation:
     - Thereâ€™s one house between horses and carnations:
     - If we assume House 4 is lilies, leaving horses in House 2 being eliminated.

8. **Final Assignments**:
   - By deduction, we configure as follows:
     - **House 1**: Cat Lover
     - **House 2**: Tulips owner (Fish must be the only one left)
     - **House 3**: Dog owner (unknown flowers)
     - **House 4**: Daffodils owner (possible remaining).

9. **Consolidating the Deductions**:
   - The protruding area indicates:
     - One last analysis shows available slots where fish must occupy House 3.

10. **Conclusion**:
   - Garage left unresolved must show:
     The only remaining potential for the fish has eliminated down to:
     - House 1: Cat Lover
     - House 2: Tulips
     - House 3: Dog
     - House 4: Fish or reversed with lilies.

Thus finalizing that house containing the fish enthusiast properly slot measures into House 2.

**Final Answer**: The house where the fish enthusiast lives is **house number 4**.
