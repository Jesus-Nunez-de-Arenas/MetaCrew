I now can give a great answer.

To solve the puzzle systematically, we'll analyze clues step by step to derive the possible arrangements for each house and their characteristics:

1. **House Information**: We are given 4 houses numbered 1 to 4.
2. **Characteristics**: Each resident has a different pet (Horses, Dogs, Cats, Fish) and a different floral arrangement (Tulips, Lilies, Carnations, Daffodils).

3. **Clue Breakdown**:
   - **Clue 1**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly to the left of the dog owner.
   - **Clue 2**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who owns horses lives and the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the person who owns horses.
   - **Clue 5**: The cat lover lives in the first house.

4. **Initial Assignments**:
   - Based on **Clue 5**, we immediately know that:
     - House 1: Cat lover

5. **Analyzing House 1**: 
   - Now that House 1 is occupied, let's consider the implications of other clues:
     - From **Clue 1**, since House 1 is the cat lover, House 2 must either be the tulip owner or a pet owner.
     - The daffodil owner cannot be in House 2 (**Clue 2**), so that means:
       - House 2 must have tulips or cannot be the dog owner.

6. **Implications of Tulips and Dogs**:
   - If House 2 is the tulip owner, then by **Clue 1**, the dog owner must be in House 3 or House 4.
   - If House 2 has tulips, then House 3 would have a dog, and thus House 4 would need a daffodil owner in contradiction with clue 2.

7. **Further Deductions**:
   - This indicates House 2 cannot have tulips, so:
     - If House 1 is Cat:
     - House 2 must be assigned a flower (daffodil) which are later assigned.
     - It leads us to: House 2: Daffodil owner (not tulip owner).
   - Then tulips can only occupy House 3 with dogs in House 4.

8. **Summarizing Potential Assignments**:
   - Now, let's summarize the potential situations:
     - **House 1**: Cat Lover
     - **House 2**: Daffodils
     - **House 3**: Tulips & Dogs
     - **House 4**: Must be Horse & Lilies ideally.

9. **Identifying Missing Features**:
   - It results in identifying that remaining characteristics need to be allocated:
     - One position must be for horses separated from the carnations which cannot occupy those as per **Clue 3**.

10. **Final Arrangements**:
   - Based on total summarizations:
     - House 1: Cat (no flowers specified)
     - House 2: Fish enthusiast with Daffodils
     - House 3: Horses with Tulips
     - House 4: Dog owner with Lilies.

The only space left for the fish enthusiast then belongs to House 2. 

**Final Answer**: The house where the fish enthusiast lives is **house number 2**.
