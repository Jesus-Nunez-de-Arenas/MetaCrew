I now can give a great answer.

To solve the puzzle systematically, I'll analyze clues one by one and derive the necessary relationships:

1. **House Information**: We have 4 houses numbered 1 to 4.
2. **Characters**: 
   - Pets: Horses, Dogs, Cats, Fish
   - Flowers: Tulips, Lilies, Carnations, Daffodils

3. **Clue Breakdown**:
   - **Clue 1**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - **Clue 2**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - **Clue 3**: There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - **Clue 4**: The person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the horse owner.
   - **Clue 5**: The cat lover lives in the first house.

4. **Placement Analysis**:
   - From **Clue 5**, House 1 must be the Cat lover.
   - The pet assignments so far: 
     - House 1: Cat lover
   - Since the tulips owner must be to the left of the dog owner (**Clue 1**), possible configurations start forming for houses 2, 3, and 4.

5. **Flower and Pet Relationships**:
   - Given that the daffodil owner cannot be in house 2 (**Clue 2**), it could only be in house 3 or house 4.
   - If tulips owner is in house 2, then dog owner must be in house 3, and this creates a conflict as daffodils would need to go to house 4, leaving no place for flowers for house 3.

6. **Logical Deductions**:
   - Since the tulips owner cannot be in house 2 (conflict with house 4's potential daffodil owner), this forces tulips to be in house 3 with the dog owner in house 4:
     - House 1: Cat lover
     - House 2: (unknown, but tulips is eliminated)
     - House 3: Tulips owner
     - House 4: Dog owner
   - This means horse owner must be in house 4 with a separation from carnations (house must be 2). Hence:
     - House 1: Cat lover (no specified pet, no specified flowers)
     - House 2: Daffodils owner
     - House 3: Tulips owner
     - House 4: Dog owner (none)

7. **Final Assignment**:
   - So now, (by elimination):
     House 1: Cat, no flowers
     House 2: Daffodils
     House 3: Tulips (must have horses)
     House 4: Dogs

8. **Resultant Findings**:
   - The only option left for fish enthusiast would actually take place in house 2.
   - Thus based upon my logical deductions leading to this configuration, I can confirm:

**Final Answer**: The house where the fish enthusiast lives is **house number 4**.
