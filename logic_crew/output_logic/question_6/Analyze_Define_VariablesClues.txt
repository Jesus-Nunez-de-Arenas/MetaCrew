1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in a row. In this specific problem, n = 3, as there are three houses numbered from 1 to 3.

2. **houses**: These are the physical locations where the individuals live. They are numbered sequentially from 1 to n (1, 2, 3), with each house corresponding to one resident who has distinct characteristics.

3. **characteristics**: This variable encompasses the unique traits of each resident in the houses. There are three main categories of characteristics present in this puzzle:
   - **Sports**: Each person plays a different sport:
     - A soccer player
     - A basketball player
     - A swimmer
   - **Fruits**: Each person is eating a different kind of fruit:
     - A banana
     - Mangos
     - Oranges
   - **Flowers**: Each person has different types of flowers in their foyer:
     - A vase of tulips
     - A bouquet of lilies
     - A bouquet of daffodils

4. **clues provided**: These clues outline conditions that must be satisfied, aiding in identifying relationships among the residents' characteristics:
   - **Clue 1**: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating oranges.
   - **Clue 2**: The swimmer and the person who has a bouquet of daffodils live directly next to each other.
   - **Clue 3**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating mangos.
   - **Clue 4**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges.

By analyzing these variables and the clues, we can deduce the arrangement of individuals, their fruits, and flowers. 

From the clues:
- **Clue 1** indicates the soccer player must be in house 1 or 2 (because they are left of someone eating oranges).
- **Clue 4** suggests the person eating oranges must be in house 1 or 2 (since the daffodil person must be to their right).
- Since the daffodil person must be adjacent to the swimmer (Clue 2), and knowing the fruit arrangements from Clue 4, we find that:
  - The swimmer must be in House 3 (next to the daffodils).
  
Putting it all together, through deduction based on placement rules, we find that the person with the bouquet of daffodils must reside in **House 3**.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives is **3**.
