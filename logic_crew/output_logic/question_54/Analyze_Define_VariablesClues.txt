1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 3. The houses are numbered from 1 (left) to 3 (right).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical locations where individuals live. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  

3. **characteristics**: Each person living in the houses has various attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Lunch**: Every person had a different meal for lunch, specifically including:
     - Spaghetti
     - Pizza
     - Fried Rice
   - **Shoes**: Each person is wearing different types of shoes, including:
     - Loafers
     - Running Shoes
     - Boots

4. **clues**: The logical statements provided are crucial for establishing the relationships and arrangement of individuals within their households. The clues are as follows:  
   - Clue 1: The person who ate fried rice does not live in the second house.  
   - Clue 2: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who ate fried rice.  
   - Clue 3: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the first house.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is wearing loafers does not live in the first house.  

Using the clues, we can derive the following conclusions:  
- From Clue 3, we establish that the person who ate spaghetti is in **House 1**.
- From Clue 1, since the person who ate fried rice does not live in House 2, and with Clue 2 indicating that the person wearing boots must be directly left of the person who ate fried rice, it implies that the boots wearer must be in **House 2**, making the person who ate fried rice reside in **House 3**.
- This arrangement leads us to then conclude that House 2 contains the person wearing boots, and House 1 has the person who ate spaghetti.
- Based on Clue 4, since the person in loafers cannot live in House 1 (where the spaghetti eater lives), it must mean the person with loafers is in **House 2**.

This leads to the following arrangement:
- **House 1**: Person who ate spaghetti, shoes unknown.
- **House 2**: Person wearing boots, thus sandwiches from the previous deduction would put pizza here (as spaghetti is in House 1 and fried rice in House 3).
- **House 3**: Person who ate fried rice, thus they would be in loafers, which we previously determined cannot belong to House 1.

Therefore, the final arrangement would be:
- House 1: Spaghetti, unknown shoes (not loafers).
- House 2: Pizza, wearing boots.
- House 3: Fried rice, wearing loafers.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is House **3**.
