Based on the clues provided, let's systematically analyze and assign characteristics to each house:

| House Number | Device      | Flowers               | Instrument   | Pet        | Book                  |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 1            | Gameboy     | Carnations            | Percussionist| Horses     | History book buff     |
| 2            | Computer    | Lilies                | Flutist      | Bird       | Mystery book reader    |
| 3            | Phone       | Rose bouquet          | Cellist      | Fish       | Romance book lover    |

From the clues:
1. The bird keeper does not live in House 1.
2. The mystery book reader lives in House 2.
3. The bird keeper does not live in House 3, meaning they must live in House 2.
4. The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies (House 1 is the only possible location for history and House 2 is flowers).
5. The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer (consistent with our setup).
6. The fish enthusiast does not reside in House 1 (confirms arrange of fish in House 3).
7. The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet (confirming roses in House 3).
8. The cellist does not reside in House 3 (confirming they are in House 2).

Analyzing the structure, we can see:

- The person with the gameboy (House 1) is to the left of the person with the rose bouquet (House 3).
- The person in House 2 aligns with the clues about being a mystery book reader, bird keeper with a computer.

Thus, the person who has a gameboy lives in House 1.
