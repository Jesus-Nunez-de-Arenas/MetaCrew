Based on the clues and the deductions made, the arrangement of the houses is as follows:

| House Number | Favorite Drink | Musical Instrument | Pet        | Book Preference        |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| 1            | Tea            | Guitar              | Horses     | History book buff       |
| 2            | Root Beer      | (Adjacent)          | Cat        | Mystery book reader     |

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who owns horses lives is house number 1.
