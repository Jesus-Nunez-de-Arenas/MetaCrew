1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 2. The houses are numbered from 1 to 2, with house number 1 on the left and house number 2 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 2 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **What they ate for lunch**: One ate fried rice and one ate spaghetti.  
   - **Musical instrument**: One plays the flute and one plays the cello.  
   - **Type of shoes**: One is wearing loafers and one is wearing sandals.  
   - **Favorite color**: One likes white and one likes green.  
   - **Car type**: One owns a sedan and one owns an SUV.  

4. **clues**: The provided clues establish relationships among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 2: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the second house.  
   - Clue 3: The flutist lives directly left of the person who likes white.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who likes white.  

Using the clues, we can analyze the following:  
- From Clue 1, since the person who ate fried rice does not live in House 1, they must live in House 2. Thus, the person in House 1 ate spaghetti.  
- Clue 2 indicates that the person who owns an SUV does not live in House 2, therefore, the person with the SUV must live in House 1, as House 2 is the one who ate fried rice.
- Continuing from this, if the flutist lives left of the person who likes white, the flutist must live in House 1 and must own the SUV (since the person who owns the SUV cannot live in House 2).  
- Therefore, the person in House 2, who ate fried rice, must be wearing sandals and likes the color white.

Finally, the person who is wearing sandals is in House 2. Thus, the answer is:  
The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **2**.
