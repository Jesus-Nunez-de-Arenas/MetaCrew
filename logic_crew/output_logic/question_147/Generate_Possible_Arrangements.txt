The person wearing high heels lives in House 2. 

To elaborate on the solution: 

Based on the clues provided:
1. The person who drinks water must live in House 1 (directly left of the person wearing high heels).
2. The person who wears sandals must live in House 1 (directly left of the person who likes yellow).
3. The individual eating kiwis resides in House 2.

From the deductions, we have established that:

- House 2 has the person drinking milk, wearing high heels, and eating kiwis.

This leads us to the conclusion that the person wearing high heels indeed lives in House 2.
