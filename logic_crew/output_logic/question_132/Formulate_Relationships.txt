To solve the puzzle, we need to analyze the provided clues in a structured manner. Let's denote the houses, the types of musicians, and the fruits visually:

| House Number | Musical Instrument | Fruit         |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1            | Violinist          | Oranges       |
| 2            | Flutist            | Grapes        |
| 3            | Pianist            | Kiwis         |

### Analysis of Clues:
1. **Clue 1:** The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - This means the pianist cannot be in House 1 since there's no left neighbor; hence the only possibility is:
     - House 2 or House 3 must be the pianist.

2. **Clue 2:** The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - The only arrangement that maintains this order with three houses is:
     - House 1 must be the violinist and House 2 must be the flutist.

3. **Clue 3:** There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - This means if kiwis are in House 3, then grapes must be in House 2, or vice versa.

4. **Clue 4:** There is one house between where the violinist lives and the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - Since the violinist is in House 1, kiwis must be in House 3 (which also aligns with having one house gap).

With this arrangement, we can confirm:
- The only house left for the flutist and grapes is House 2.
- The musician arrangements harmonize with the fruits as follows.

### Conclusion:
- House 1: Violinist (eating Oranges)
- House 2: Flutist (eating Grapes)
- House 3: Pianist (eating Kiwis)

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is **3**.
