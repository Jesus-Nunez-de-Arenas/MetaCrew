Based on the analysis of the clues, the arrangement of the houses and their corresponding characteristics is as follows:

| House Number | Musical Instrument | Fruit         |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 1            | Violinist          | Oranges       |
| 2            | Flutist            | Grapes        |
| 3            | Pianist            | Kiwis         |

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is 3.
