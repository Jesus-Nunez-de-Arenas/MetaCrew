Based on the clues provided and the analysis, we can create a structured representation of the relationships between houses and their respective characteristics:

| House Number | Favorite Drink | Shoes         |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1            | Water          | Loafers       |
| 2            | Milk           | High Heels    |
| 3            | Coffee         | Running Shoes  |

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**. The person wearing high heels resides in House 2.
