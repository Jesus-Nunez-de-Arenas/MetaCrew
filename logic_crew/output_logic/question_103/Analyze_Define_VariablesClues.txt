1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 3. The houses are numbered from 1 on the left to 3 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 3 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Favorite Drink**: One person likes milk, another only drinks water, and the third is a coffee drinker.  
   - **Shoes**: One person is wearing loafers, one is wearing running shoes, and one is wearing high heels.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the second house.  
   - Clue 2: The coffee drinker does not live in the second house.  
   - Clue 3: The person who likes milk does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 4: The coffee drinker does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 5: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the third house.

**Analyzing the clues**:

- From **Clue 1**, we know that the person wearing high heels lives in House 2. 
- From **Clue 2**, since the coffee drinker does not live in House 2, then either House 1 or House 3 must be the coffee drinker's location.
- From **Clue 3**, since the person who likes milk does not live in House 1, it implies that they must live in House 3.
- From **Clue 4**, since the coffee drinker does not live in House 1, the coffee drinker has to live in House 3.
- From **Clue 5**, the person who is wearing running shoes is confirmed to live in House 3.

Thus, we have:
- House 1: Must be the person who drinks water and wears loafers.
- House 2: The person wears high heels and must therefore be the one who likes milk (because House 1 has water and House 3 must be the coffee drinker).
- House 3: The person who wears running shoes is the coffee drinker.

Summary of characteristics per house:
- **House 1**:  
  - Shoes: Loafers  
  - Drink: Water  

- **House 2**:  
  - Shoes: High Heels  
  - Drink: Milk  

- **House 3**:  
  - Shoes: Running Shoes  
  - Drink: Coffee  

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**.
