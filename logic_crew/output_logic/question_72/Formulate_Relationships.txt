After logically deducing the relationships between the houses and their respective characteristics based on the clues provided, we can summarize the information in a structured manner.

| House Number | Sport          | Fruit    | Book               | Color  |
|--------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|--------|
| 1            | Swimmer        | Kiwis    | Romance            | Red    |
| 2            | Cricketer      | Oranges  | History            | White  |
| 3            | Golfer         | Mangos   | Science Fiction     | Yellow |
| 4            | Tennis Player   | Banana   | Fantasy            | Green  |
| 5            | Basketball Player | Grapes | Mystery            | Blue   |

Upon correlating the attributes with the clues:
- The person who is eating kiwis (House 1, Swimmer) lives directly left of the tennis player (House 4).
- The mystery book reader (House 5) lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating oranges (House 2).
- The cricketer (House 2) lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes yellow (House 3).
- The golfer (House 3) and the science fiction book fanatic (House 4) live directly next to each other.
- The swimmer (House 1) lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes green (House 4).
- The person who likes blue (House 5) does indeed live in that house.
- The cricketer (House 2) lives directly left of the person who likes white (House 2) and the fantasy book enthusiast (House 4).
- There are two houses between where the romance book lover (House 1) lives and where the tennis player lives (House 4).
- The person who is eating a banana (House 4) does not live in house 5.
- There is one house between where the person who is eating mangos (House 3) lives and where the person who likes green (House 4) lives.
- There are two houses between where the romance book lover (House 1) lives and where the mystery book reader lives (House 5).

After analyzing and arranging these relationships logically, we conclude that the history book buff lives in House 2. The number of the house where the history book buff lives is **2**.
