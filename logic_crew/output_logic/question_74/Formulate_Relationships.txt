To clarify the relationships among the houses and their respective characteristics based on the provided clues, we can structure the information as follows:

| House Number | Car Type   | Device     |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| 1            | Minivan    | ???        |
| 2            | Convertible | Computer   |
| 3            | Truck      | Gameboy    |
| 4            | SUV        | Radio      |

**Analysis of the clues:**
1. The person who has a gameboy **lives in the third house** (House 3 has the gameboy).
2. The person who drives a **minivan lives in the first house** (House 1 has the minivan).
3. The person who **has a phone lives directly left** of the person who owns an SUV, which means that House 2 must contain the person with the phone, leading to House 4 being the SUV owner.
4. The person who has a radio lives **somewhere to the right** of the person who has a gameboy confirms that the radio must be in House 4.
5. The person who drives a **convertible does not live in the third house**, confirming that House 2 is the convertible owner.
6. The person who has a **computer does not live in the first house**, so House 2 must be the computer owner.

Based on the above deductions:
- Therefore, **House 1** has a minivan, the device is still undetermined.
- **House 2** showcases a convertible and has the computer.
- **House 3** confirms its owner drives a truck and uses a gameboy.
- Finally, **House 4** belongs to the SUV owner and has a radio.

Overall conclusion: The person who owns an SUV lives in **House 4**.
