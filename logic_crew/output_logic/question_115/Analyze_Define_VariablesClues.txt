4. **clues**: The clues provided in the problem serve to establish relationships and constraints among the residents' characteristics. The clues are as follows:
   - Clue 1: There is one house between where the swimmer lives and where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
   - Clue 2: The golfer lives in the second house.
   - Clue 3: The history book buff lives in the first house.

By analyzing these clues in conjunction:
- From Clue 2, we know the golfer is in **House 2**.
- From Clue 3, we know the history book buff is in **House 1**.
- This means the swimmer must be in **House 3** because there is one house (House 2) between the swimmer (House 3) and the science fiction book fanatic, who must be in **House 2** since the golfer lives there.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the swimmer resides in **House 3**. 

Thus, the number of the house where the swimmer lives is **3**.
