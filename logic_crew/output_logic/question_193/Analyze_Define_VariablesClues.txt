     - Lilies bouquet  
     - Carnations arrangement  
     - Tulips vase  

4. **clues**: The problem provides several clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a convertible.  
   - Clue 2: The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.  
   - Clue 3: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of daffodils.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating a banana lives in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 5: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a carnations arrangement.  
   - Clue 6: There is one house between where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives and where the person who has a bouquet of lilies lives.  
   - Clue 7: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who drives a minivan.  
   - Clue 8: The person who is eating grapes does not live in the fifth house.  
   - Clue 9: The person who owns an SUV lives in the fourth house.

Through careful deduction using these clues, we analyze the house characteristics step by step:

1. From Clue 2: Oranges are eaten in House 1.
2. From Clue 4: Banana is eaten in House 4.
3. From Clue 9: The SUV is in House 4.
4. From Clue 3: Since House 1 has oranges, Apples must be in House 2 (directly left to Daffodils).
5. Therefore, Daffodils must be in House 3 (as per Clue 3).
6. As there's 1 house between Carnations and Lilies (Clue 6), Carnations must be in House 2, and Lilies must be in House 5.
7. Also, from Clue 5, the Sedan cannot be in House 2; it has to be in House 5.
8. Finally, that leaves Grapes in House 3.

The final arrangement becomes:
- House 1: Oranges, (unknown car), (unknown flowers)
- House 2: Apples, (unknown car), Carnations
- House 3: Grapes, (unknown car), Daffodils
- House 4: Banana, SUV, Tulips
- House 5: (unknown fruit), Sedan, Lilies

Conclusively, the only house left for the Sedan (according to our clues) is House 5.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who owns a sedan lives is 5.
