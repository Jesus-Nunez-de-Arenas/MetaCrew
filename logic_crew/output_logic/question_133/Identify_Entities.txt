1. **n**: The total number of houses in the scenario is 2.

2. **houses**: There are 2 houses, specifically numbered 1 on the left and 2 on the right.

3. **characteristics**:
   - Each person living in the houses is eating a different kind of fruit: one is eating kiwis and one is eating oranges.
   - Each person has different book preferences: one is a history book buff and the other is a fantasy book enthusiast.

4. **clue(s) provided**:
   - **Clue 1**: The fantasy book enthusiast does not live in the first house.
   - **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.

By analyzing the clues:
- From **Clue 2**, we know that the person in the first house (House 1) is eating kiwis.
- From **Clue 1**, since the fantasy book enthusiast does not live in House 1, they must live in House 2.

Therefore, based on the logical deduction from the given clues:
- The occupant of House 1 is eating kiwis and cannot be the fantasy book enthusiast.
- Consequently, the occupant of House 2 must be the fantasy book enthusiast.

Thus, the number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **2**.
