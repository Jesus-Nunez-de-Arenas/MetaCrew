Define_Variables:
  description: >
    Identify the variables for the cost of the bottle and the cap. Let C represent the cost of the cap and B represent the cost of the bottle.
  expected_output: >
    Variables defined: C (cap cost), B (bottle cost)
Set_Up_Equations:
  description: >
    Formulate the equations based on the problem statement: (1) B + C = 110 and (2) B = C + 100.
  expected_output: >
    Equations established: B + C = 110; B = C + 100
Substitute_and_Rearrange:
  description: >
    Substitute the value of B from the second equation into the first equation and rearrange to solve for C.
  expected_output: >
    Rearranged equation results in a single equation in C.
Solve_for_C:
  description: >
    Calculate the value of C, which represents the cost of the cap, using the rearranged equation.
  expected_output: >
    C, the cost of the cap, determined.
Confirm_Result:
  description: >
    Verify that the values of C and B satisfy both original equations and confirm that the solution makes sense in the context.
  expected_output: >
    Both original equations satisfied: B + C = 110 and B - C = 100.
