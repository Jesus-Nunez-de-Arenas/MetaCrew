To substitute the value of B from the second equation into the first equation and solve for C:

1. Start with the given equations:
   - Equation 1: B + C = 110
   - Equation 2: B = C + 100
   
2. Substitute the value of B from Equation 2 into Equation 1:
   - C + 100 + C = 110

3. Combine like terms:
   - 2C + 100 = 110

4. To isolate C, subtract 100 from both sides:
   - 2C = 110 - 100
   - 2C = 10

5. Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for C:
   - C = 10 / 2
   - C = 5

Thus, the rearranged equation results in C = 5, indicating the cost of the cap is 5. The final answer is:

C = 5.
