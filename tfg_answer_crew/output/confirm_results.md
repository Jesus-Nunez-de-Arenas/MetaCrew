The values of C and B have been verified to satisfy both original equations. Specifically, with C = 5, we calculate B as follows: 

1. From the first equation, B + C = 110, substituting C gives us B + 5 = 110, leading to B = 105.
2. From the second equation, B - C = 100, substituting C gives us B - 5 = 100, confirming B = 105.

Both equations are satisfied:
- B + C = 105 + 5 = 110 is correct.
- B - C = 105 - 5 = 100 is correct.

Thus, the solution makes sense in the context, and the final values are confirmed: B = 105 and C = 5.
