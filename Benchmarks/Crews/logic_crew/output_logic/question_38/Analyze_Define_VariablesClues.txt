1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4. The houses are numbered from 1 to 4, with house number 1 on the left and house number 4 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 4 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Sport**: Each person plays a different sport: one is a swimmer, one is a soccer player, one is a tennis player, and one is a basketball player.  
   - **Car type**: Each person has a different kind of car: one owns a sedan, one drives an SUV, one drives a truck, and one drives a minivan.  
   - **Drink**: Each person has a favorite drink: one only drinks water, one is a tea drinker, one is a root beer lover, and one is a coffee drinker.  
   - **Flowers**: Each person has different flowers in their foyer: one has a carnations arrangement, one has a bouquet of lilies, one has a bouquet of daffodils, and one has a rose bouquet.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: There is one house between where the coffee drinker lives and where the tennis player lives.  
   - Clue 2: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils and the person who has a bouquet of lilies live directly next to each other.  
   - Clue 3: The swimmer lives directly left of the person who owns a sedan.  
   - Clue 4: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who has a carnations arrangement.  
   - Clue 5: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives somewhere to the right of the basketball player.  
   - Clue 6: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the tea drinker.  
   - Clue 7: The swimmer does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 8: The basketball player lives directly left of the person who drives a truck.  
   - Clue 9: The person who drives a minivan lives in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 10: The root beer lover lives in the third house.  

Using these clues, we can analyze the relationships and deduce the locations of each individual based on their characteristics. After carefully processing the information:

- The root beer lover lives in House 3 (Clue 10).
- The minivan is driven by the person in House 4 (Clue 9).
- The swimmer must be in House 2 (as House 1 is ruled out and must be left of the person who owns a sedan, thus far only House 3 is taken).
- Basketball player in House 1 (left of the Truck driver who is in House 2).
- The person who drinks coffee must then live in House 1 (Clue 6 indicates the tennis player must be right of the coffee drinker, but House 1 is the only option left).
- The carnations arrangement cannot be in House 2 or House 3, thus must be in House 1.
- This places the tennis player in House 2 with teedrinker while leaving daffodils and lilies to House 3 and House 2 directly next together.

Ultimately, this reasoning concludes that the truck will reside in House 2 and the final arrangement is:
1. House 1: Basketball Player - Coffee - Carnations - SUV
2. House 2: Tennis Player - Tea - Daffodils - Truck
3. House 3: Root Beer Lover - Sedans - Lilies - Swimmer
4. House 4: Soccer Player - Water - Roses - Minivan

Thus, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **2**.
