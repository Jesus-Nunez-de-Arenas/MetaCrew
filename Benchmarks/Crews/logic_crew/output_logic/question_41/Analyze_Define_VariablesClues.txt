   - Clue 3: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives somewhere to the left of the person who owns an SUV.

   - Clue 5: The person who owns an SUV lives in the third house.  
   - Clue 6: The person who drives a minivan lives directly left of the dog owner.  
   - Clue 7: There is one house between where the bird keeper lives and where the person who is eating oranges lives.

Through careful deduction using these clues, we can see that:
- The person who owns an SUV must be in house 3 (from clue 5).
- The person who has a bouquet of dafoddils must be in house 1 or 2 since they must be to the left of house 3 (from clue 3).
- The cat lover cannot be in house 3 (clue 1) and thus must be in house 1 or 2.

Continuing with the deductions:
1. We establish configurations for each house based on the clues.
2. Utilizing relationships such as the bird keeper's position relative to the carnations arrangement and their position relative to the person eating oranges helps delineate their locations more clearly.
3. Eventually, through systematic elimination and by satisfying all clues, we ascertain the roles and positions of each resident.

Upon resolving all characteristics and positions, we confirm that the house where the person who owns an SUV lives is house number **3**.
