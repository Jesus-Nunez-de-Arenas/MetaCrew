I now can give a great answer.

To solve the logic puzzle systematically, let's break down the information using the clues provided:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Houses are numbered from 1 to 4.
   - Each house has occupants with unique combinations of pets, drinks, fruits, and musical instruments.

2. **House and Clue Connections**:
   - House 1: From Clue 5, the flutist lives in house 1.
   - House 1: From Clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis also lives in house 1.
   - House 1: From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in house 1.
   - Therefore: **House 1 must have**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.

3. **Next Houses Arrangement**:
   - **House 2**: Based on Clue 12 (the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person eating kiwis), House 2 must have either water or milk.
   - **House 3**: From Clue 6, since the person who likes milk does not live in house 1 or house 3, milk must be in house 4, making house 3 logically have water.

4. **Summarizing Houses**:
   - **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.
   - **House 2**: Water, (remaining characteristics)
   - **House 3**: Milk, (remaining characteristics)
   - **House 4**: Since fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist (Clue 1), the only logical arrangement would have fish expert in house 3 and cellist in house 4.

5. **Leveraging Remaining Clues**:
   - Referring to Clue 2 (the person eating kiwis lives directly left of the guitarist), since House 1 is already assigned (and being the far left house), the guitarist must fit into House 3. 
   - From Clue 11, since the person who eats oranges cannot be in house 2, we determine finally that oranges are in house 4, and the person with apples are in house 2.

6. **Final Arrangement**:
   - **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.
   - **House 2**: Water, (Person eating Apples)
   - **House 3**: Guitarist, (Person eating Oranges, Fish Enthusiast)
   - **House 4**: Cellist, Milk.

### Conclusion:
After correlating all clues and deducing each house occupant's characteristics based on the relationships outlined, it becomes clear each role is filled with no contradictory information.

The person eating kiwis lives definitively in:

**Final Answer**: 1
