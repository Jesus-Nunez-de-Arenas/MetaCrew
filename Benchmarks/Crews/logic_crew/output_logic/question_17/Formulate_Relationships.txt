I now can give a great answer. 

To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the clues step-by-step to determine the occupants of each house based on their characteristics.

**Initial Setup:**
1. **House Configuration:**
   - There are 4 houses: 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   
**Clues Breakdown:**
1. From Clue 5, the flutist lives in the first house.
2. From Clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.
3. From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in the first house.

**So currently**, in House 1 we have:
- **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Eating Kiwis.

4. From Clue 12, the person who only drinks water lives somewhere to the **right of** the person who is eating kiwis. Since kiwis are in House 1, the person who drinks water must be either in House 2, 3, or 4.
5. From Clue 4, the person who likes milk and the person who only drinks water live directly next to each other. This means that if water is in House 2, then milk has to be in House 3, or vice-versa.

### Analysis of Other Clues
6. From Clue 6, the person who likes milk does not live in the first house, so milk must be in House 3 or 4.
7. From Clue 7, the person who likes milk does not live in the third house, meaning milk must be in House 4, leading to:
- **House 3**: Water (must be the only drink left).
- **House 4**: Milk.

8. Now we know:
- **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.
- **House 2**: Water.
- **House 3**: Cellist (from Clue 1, the fish enthusiast lives directly left of the cellist, as we have determined the setup).
- **House 4**: Milk.

9. From Clue 3, there is one house between where the person is eating apples and where the person is eating oranges. Given that:
   - Apples must be in House 2 (so we can have oranges in 4), or vice-versa.
   - Since House 2 has Water, the remaining fruit arrangement must have Apples in House 3 and Oranges in House 4.

10. From Clue 10, the fish enthusiast and the horse owner live directly next to one another. Thus, if we make sure:
- **House 1**: Fish Enthusiast.
- **House 2**: Oranges.
- **House 3**: Cellist.
- **House 4**: Milk.

### Final Character Assignment:
- **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.
- **House 2**: Water, Eating Apples.
- **House 3**: Guitarist, Eating Oranges.
- **House 4**: Milk, Fish Enthusiast, Horse Owner.

### Conclusion:
Putting all the clues together based on the logical deductions:
- The person living in House 1, who is eating kiwis, is also assigned as the Flutist and Cat Lover.

**Final Answer**: 1
