I now can give a great answer.

To solve the logic puzzle systematically, let's break down the information using the clues provided:

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Houses are numbered from 1 to 4.
   - Each house has occupants with unique combinations of pets, drinks, fruits, and musical instruments.

2. **House and Clue Connections**:
   - From Clue 5, the flutist lives in house 1.
   - From Clue 8, the person who is eating kiwis also lives in house 1.
   - From Clue 13, the cat lover lives in house 1.
   - Therefore: **House 1 must have**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.

3. **Next Houses Arrangement**:
   - **House 2**: Based on Clue 12 (the person who only drinks water lives to the right of the person eating kiwis), House 2 must have either water or milk.
   - According to Clue 4, since the person who likes milk must live directly next to the water drinker, milk must not be in House 1 but could be in House 3 or 4.
   - However, Clue 6 states that the person who likes milk does not live in House 1, and Clue 7 states that they do not live in the third house either. Thus, milk must be in House 4, which means water is in House 3.

4. **Arranging Houses Further**:
   - **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.
   - **House 2**: Eating Apples (must be inferred based on the other clues).
   - **House 3**: Water, and by process of elimination, since Oranges cannot be in House 2 (Clue 11), the only remaining fruit for House 3 is Mangos.
   - **House 4**: Milk, and by knowing that the Fish Enthusiast must be directly left of the Cellist (Clue 1), the only spotting left would have to fill as Fish Enthusiast must be House 3 and therefore House 4 can only be the Cellist.

5. **Validating and Concluding the Arrangement**:
   - **House 1**: Flutist, Cat Lover, Kiwis.
   - **House 2**: (Horse Owner, must love Apples).
   - **House 3**: Water (Fish Enthusiast, Eating Mangos).
   - **House 4**: Cellist (who drinks Milk).

### Final Summary:
The person eating kiwis is definitely living in:

**Final Answer**: 1
