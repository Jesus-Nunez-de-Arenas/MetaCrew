1. **n**: This variable represents the number of houses in the problem. In this scenario, n equals 5, as there are a total of 5 houses numbered from 1 to 5.

2. **houses**: This variable denotes the specific locations where each person lives. The houses are numbered sequentially from 1 to 5, with house 1 on the leftmost side and house 5 on the rightmost side. Each house contains one person with unique characteristics.

3. **characteristics**: This variable refers to the distinct traits assigned to each individual living in the houses. Each person has a favorite drink (tea, milk, water, coffee, root beer), flowers in their foyer (tulips, roses, lilies, daffodils, carnations), a lunch they ate (fried rice, pizza, spaghetti, stew, grilled cheese), and a favorite color (white, green, red, yellow, blue).

4. **clues**: These are the provided statements that outline the relationships and positioning of the characteristics among the individuals living in the houses. Each clue aids in logically deducing which person occupies which house and their respective characteristics.

- Clue 1: The person who likes blue lives directly left of the person who had pizza.
- Clue 2: The tea drinker lives in the first house.
- Clue 3: The tea drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who has a rose bouquet.
- Clue 4: The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the fifth house.
