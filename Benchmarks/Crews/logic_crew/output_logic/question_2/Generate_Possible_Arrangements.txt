The number of the house where the cellist lives is 2.  

Hereâ€™s the reasoning behind the answer:

1. **House 1 must contain the person who likes green and eats kiwis** (from clues 5 and 8). This means:
   - House 1: Green, Kiwis, (unknown drink, instrument, device)
  
2. **Clue 3 states the person who drinks water lives left of the root beer lover**. Thus, the possible options for House 1 or House 2 may be water, and the root beer lover must be in House 2 or House 3.

3. **From Clue 6, the person who likes blue and the gameboy owner live next to one another.** This means blue can only be associated with House 2 or 3.

4. **Clue 4 notes there is one house between the cellist and the gameboy owner**. This means that if we place the cellist in House 2, then the gameboy must be in House 3, or vice versa.

5. The only placement that maintains all clues is as follows:
   - **House 1**: Green, Kiwis, (Water drinker, unknown instrument, unknown device)
   - **House 2**: Unknown color, Unknown fruit (Root beer drinker, must be the cellist, not in House 3)
   - **House 3**: Unknown color, (Grapes or Oranges) (Gameboy user, non-cellist)

6. By deduction and the provided clues, House 2 is indeed the home of the cellist. 

Thus, the ultimate conclusion derived from the analysis of the clues leads to the fact that the cellist resides in house 2.
