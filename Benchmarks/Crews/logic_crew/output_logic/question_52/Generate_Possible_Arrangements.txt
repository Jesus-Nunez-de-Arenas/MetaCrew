| House Number | Favorite Color | Lunch    | Favorite Drink | Sport     | Type of Shoes   |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|------------------|
| 1            | White           | Stew     | Water           | Swimmer   | Loafers          |

**Analysis of Clues:**
1. **Clue 1:** The person who is wearing running shoes does not live in House 1.  
   - Therefore, House 2 must have the person in running shoes.

2. **Clue 2:** The person who likes white lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.  
   - Hence, the person in House 1 likes white, and they must be directly left of the person who ate spaghetti, who lives in House 2.

3. **Clue 3:** The baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.  
   - Since the only arrangement possible is House 2 having the baseball player and the person who ate spaghetti, they reside in House 2.

4. **Clue 4:** The person who only drinks water and the person who ate spaghetti live directly next to each other.  
   - This confirms that the person in House 1 drinks water (since they are the only neighbor of House 2 where the spaghetti eater lives).

Thus, by combining these clues, we can definitively determine the attributes of the individuals in each house. The person wearing loafers is clearly listed under House 1.

The conclusion makes it clear that the house where the person who is wearing loafers lives is indeed House 1.
