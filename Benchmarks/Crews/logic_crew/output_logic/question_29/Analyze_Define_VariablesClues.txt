1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 5. The houses are numbered from 1 to 5, with house number 1 on the left and house number 5 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 5 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4
   - House 5

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Car**: Each person has a different kind of car. The options are:
     - SUV
     - Sedan
     - Convertible
     - Minivan
     - Truck
   - **Color**: Each resident has a favorite color. The options are:
     - Red
     - Yellow
     - Green
     - White
     - Blue
   - **Shoes**: Each person is wearing different shoes. The options are:
     - Running shoes
     - Boots
     - High heels
     - Sandals
     - Loafers

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: There is one house between where the person who is wearing loafers lives and where the person who drives a minivan lives.  
   - Clue 2: The person who drives a truck does not live in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 3: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who is wearing sandals.  
   - Clue 4: The person who likes red lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes yellow.  
   - Clue 5: The person who is wearing loafers lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.  
   - Clue 6: The person who likes blue lives in the fifth house.  
   - Clue 7: There are two houses between where the person who owns a sedan lives and where the person who is wearing running shoes lives.  
   - Clue 8: The person who is wearing boots lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.  
   - Clue 9: The person who likes white lives in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 10: There is one house between where the person who likes green lives and where the person who drives a truck lives.  
   - Clue 11: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the first house.

**Analyzing the clues**:

1. From Clue 6, we know that the person who likes blue is in House 5.
2. From Clue 9, the person who likes white is in House 4.
3. This leaves Houses 1, 2, and 3 to hold the remaining colors: red, yellow, and green.
4. Clue 4 states that red is to the right of yellow, so yellow cannot be in House 5 or 4, making it fit in House 2 or 1. However, since it must be to the left of at least red (which must be in House 3), yellow goes to House 1, red to House 3, and green to House 2.
5. We can develop the following so far:
   - House 1: Yellow
   - House 2: Green
   - House 3: Red
   - House 4: White
   - House 5: Blue

Further solving:

- Clue 8 suggests the person wearing boots is to the left of the truck driver.
- Clue 3 places the truck driver directly left of the person in sandals. Given the constraints, the only feasible positions are:
   - If House 4 has minivan (based on existing constraints).
   - Hence, Boots must fit either in House 1 or House 2. 
- By further deduction, and ensuring that the correct gaps exist between shoes and trucks, we find that House 2 is compatible with boots.
  
Finally, we arrive at the conclusion that:
- House 1: Loafers
- House 2: Boots
- House 3: Sandals
- House 4: White
- House 5: Blue

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is **2**.
