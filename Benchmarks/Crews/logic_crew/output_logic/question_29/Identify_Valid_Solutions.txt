The number of the house where the person who is wearing boots lives is House 2. 

Hereâ€™s a structured approach to the solution, based on the analysis of the clues:

| House Number | Car         | Color  | Shoes       |
|--------------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 1            | Minivan     | Yellow | Loafers     |
| 2            | Truck       | Green  | Boots       |
| 3            | Sedan       | Red    | Sandals     |
| 4            | Convertible | White  | High Heels  |
| 5            | SUV         | Blue   | Running Shoes|

- **House 1**: The person wearing loafers has to be in a house that allows for a gap before the minivan (House 1 fits).
- **House 2**: The boots are to the left of the truck, which is driven in House 2.
- **House 3**: The sedan has to be there based on the spacing between colors.
- **House 4**: White is fixed here as per the clues.
- **House 5**: Blue is confirmed as per the clues.

This visualization confirms the position of each characteristic in relation to each other, leading to the firm conclusion about House 2 housing the occupant in boots.
