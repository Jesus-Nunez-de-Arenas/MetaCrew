1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 2. The houses are numbered from 1 to 2, with house number 1 on the left and house number 2 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 2 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Shoes**: One person is wearing boots and one is wearing high heels.  
   - **Pets**: One person owns horses, and one is a dog owner.  
   - **Devices**: One has a radio, and the other has a phone.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - **Clue 1**: The person who has a phone lives in the first house.  
   - **Clue 2**: The person who is wearing boots does not live in the second house.  
   - **Clue 3**: The person who owns horses and the person who has a radio live directly next to each other.  

**Analyzing the clues**:

- From **Clue 1**, we understand that the occupant of House 1 must be the person with the phone.

- From **Clue 2**, since the person wearing boots does not reside in House 2, it indicates that the person wearing boots must therefore live in House 1.

- If the person in House 1 (who has the phone) is wearing boots, then the only other shoe option, high heels, must belong to the person in House 2.

- Considering **Clue 3**, if the person in House 1 owns a dog (since they have boots and a phone), then the person in House 2 must own horses; they must also be the one who has the radio, while the person in House 1 owns a dog.

**Summary of characteristics per house**:
- **House 1**:  
  - Shoes: Boots  
  - Pet: Dog  
  - Device: Phone  

- **House 2**:  
  - Shoes: High Heels  
  - Pet: Horses  
  - Device: Radio  

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing high heels lives is **2**.
