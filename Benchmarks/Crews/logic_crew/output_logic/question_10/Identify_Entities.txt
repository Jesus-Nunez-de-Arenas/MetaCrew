1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 2. The houses are numbered from 1 to 2, with house number 1 on the left and house number 2 on the right.  

2. **houses**: There are 2 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Shoes**: One person is wearing sandals and the other is wearing boots.  
   - **Book preference**: One person likes mystery books, and the other is a history book buff.  
   - **Car type**: One person drives a convertible, and the other drives a truck.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who drives a convertible lives directly left of the history book buff.  
   - Clue 2: The person who is wearing boots does not live in the first house.  

Now let's analyze the clues:  
- From Clue 2, we know that the person wearing boots does not live in House 1. Therefore, the person in House 2 must be the one wearing boots. Thus, the person in House 1 must be wearing sandals.  
- According to Clue 1, the person who drives a convertible lives in House 1 (directly left of the history book buff), which means the person in House 1 must be the convertible driver, and therefore a mystery book reader, as they cannot be the history book buff.  
- Consequently, the person in House 2, who is wearing boots, must be the history book buff and drives a truck.

So we have the following conclusions:  
- House 1: Wearing sandals, drives a convertible, and is a mystery book reader.  
- House 2: Wearing boots, drives a truck, and is a history book buff.  

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **1**.
