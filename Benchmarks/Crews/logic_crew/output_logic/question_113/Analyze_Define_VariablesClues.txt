1. **n**: The number of houses in the scenario, which is 2.
   
2. **houses**: There are 2 houses, numbered 1 (on the left) and 2 (on the right).

3. **characteristics**:
   - **Musical instruments**: There are two instruments being played by the residents - one is a pianist and the other is a cellist.
   - **Favorite colors**: Each resident has a favorite color, with one liking red and the other liking green.
   - **Book preferences**: There are two types of books that the residents prefer - one reads mystery books and the other enjoys fantasy books.

4. **clue(s) provided**:
   - **Clue 1**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1).
   - **Clue 2**: The cellist lives in the first house (House 1).
   - **Clue 3**: The person who likes green lives somewhere to the left of the person who likes red (implying the person liking green must live in House 1 since there are only two houses, and thus House 2 must have the person who likes red).

Based on these clues and conditions, we can analyze the characteristics in relation to each house, determining that:
- House 1 (left) has the fantasy book enthusiast who is also the cellist.
- House 2 (right) must be where the mystery book reader lives (noting that there is only one left for this preference), and therefore also must be the pianist.

Thus, the number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is House 2.
