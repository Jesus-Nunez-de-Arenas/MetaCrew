The number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is House 2. 

Here is the breakdown of the house characteristics based on the clues analyzed:

1. **House Characteristics Table**

| House Number | Musical Instrument | Favorite Color | Book Preference       |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| 1            | Cellist           | Green          | Fantasy                |
| 2            | Pianist           | Red            | Mystery                |

- **House 1**:
  - **Musical Instrument**: Cellist
  - **Favorite Color**: Green
  - **Book Preference**: Fantasy

- **House 2**:
  - **Musical Instrument**: Pianist
  - **Favorite Color**: Red
  - **Book Preference**: Mystery

According to the clues:
- Clue 1 states that the fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house (House 1), which is confirmed as the place where the cellist also resides.
- Clue 2 reiterates that the cellist lives in the first house.
- Clue 3 indicates the person who likes green must live to the left of the person who likes red. Since House 1 is on the left, it must contain the person who likes green, establishing that the person in House 2 (to the right) must like red.

Thus, the mystery book reader, not mentioned as living in House 1, inevitably resides in House 2. Therefore, the logical conclusion indicates that the mystery book reader lives in House 2.
