1. **n (Number of Houses)**: The total number of houses is 3.

2. **houses (Structure)**: A sequence of house numbers from 1 to 3, indicating the order of the houses from left to right.

3. **Occupants (People)**: There is one person living in each house.

4. **characteristics (Attributes)**: Each person in the houses has distinct characteristics:
   - **Musical Instruments**:

     - Violinist
     - Percussionist
   - **Shoes**: 
     - Running Shoes
     - High Heels

     - Kiwis
   - **Devices**:

     - Phone
     - Radio

5. **clues (Information)**: These are critical statements that help narrow down the positions and characteristics:
   1. The pianist does not live in the first house.
   2. The person who is eating oranges lives somewhere to the right of the person who is eating kiwis.
   3. The person who is wearing high heels and the pianist live directly next to each other.
   4. The person who is wearing running shoes and the percussionist live directly next to each other.
   5. The person who is eating kiwis lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing boots.
   6. The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing high heels.
   7. The person who is eating oranges lives directly left of the person who has a television.

Through analyzing the clues systematically, we can derive the arrangement of the houses and the characteristics of their occupants. After piecing together the relationships and characteristics, we find:

- House 1: The person who eats Kiwis and has a Radio.
- House 2: The person who wears High Heels and is the Pianist (next to House 1).
- House 3: The person eating Oranges, has a Television.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a television lives is **3**.
