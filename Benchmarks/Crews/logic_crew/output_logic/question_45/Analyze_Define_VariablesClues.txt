In this problem, we have several variables:

1. **n (the number of houses)**: In this scenario, n is equal to 3, indicating there are three houses in a row.
   
2. **houses**: The houses are numbered from 1 to 3, representing their positions from left to right. Each house contains one person with distinct characteristics.

3. **characteristics**: Each person living in a house has the following characteristics that need analysis:
   - **Flowers**: One has a bouquet of lilies, one has a bouquet of daffodils, and one has a carnations arrangement.
   - **Fruits**: One is eating apples, one is eating a banana, and one is eating mangos.
   - **Cars**: One owns a sedan, one drives a minivan, and one drives a truck.
   - **Musical instruments**: One plays the saxophone, one plays the cello, and one plays the violin.
   - **Favorite drinks**: One only drinks water, one is a tea drinker, and one is a root beer lover.

4. **clue(s)**: The clues provided outline specific relationships and positioning of the houses and their characteristics:
   - Clue 1 indicates the proximity of the water drinker and the minivan driver.
   - Clue 2 sets the position of the sedan owner concerning the mango eater.
   - Clue 3 specifies that the water drinker does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 4 identifies the location of the root beer lover in the third house.
   - Clue 5 involves the positioning of the sedan owner and the daffodil holder.
   - Clue 6 places the cellist directly left of the saxophonist.
   - Clue 7 establishes that the carnations arrangement is not in the third house.
   - Clue 8 asserts the sedan owner is directly left of the person eating apples.
   - Clue 9 means that the apple eater lives directly left of the violinist.

By analyzing these variables, we can deduce the relationships and positional characteristics to answer the query effectively. 

Through deduction:
- The root beer lover (from clue 4) lives in house 3.
- The person who drinks water cannot be in house 1 (clue 3) and must be in house 2 (because they must neighbor the minivan driver in house 1 due to clue 1).
- With house 3 being the root beer lover, house 1 must thus have the minivan driver, and thereby must have a carnation arrangement (as deduced from clue 7).
- Consequently, house 2 is the one with the sedan (clue 5) and by subsequent deduction will have lilies.
- By working through the relationships of who eats what and plays which instruments, it leads to the violinist being in house 3.

Finally, I can conclude:
The number of the house where the violinist lives is house 3.
