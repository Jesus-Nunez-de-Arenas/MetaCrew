1. **n**: This represents the number of houses in the row. In this problem, n is equal to 5 since there are five houses numbered from 1 to 5.

2. **houses**: The houses are in a sequential arrangement numbered from 1 to 5. Each house contains a unique resident who has specific characteristics. The layout is as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4
   - House 5

3. **characteristics**: Each resident of the houses has multiple attributes that are being analyzed. These characteristics include:
   - Lunch meal: There are five different lunch options - grilled cheese, stew, fried rice, pizza, and spaghetti.
   - Book preference: Each person has a different genre of book they enjoy - fantasy, romance, science fiction, mystery, and history.
   - Shoes: The residents have distinct types of footwear - running shoes, high heels, sandals, boots, and loafers.
   - Sports: Each resident participates in a unique sport - baseball, swimming, tennis, soccer, and golf.
   - Fruit: There are five different fruits being eaten - apples, oranges, mangos, kiwis, and grapes.

4. **clues**: The clues provided in the problem serve to establish relationships and constraints among the residents' characteristics. They guide the process of deduction to determine which person occupies which house based on their unique attributes. The clues indicate spatial relationships between characteristics which need to be solved logically.

Overall, the goal is to analyze these variables and clues to deduce the specific characteristics associated with each house, particularly identifying the location of the swimmer among the five houses.
