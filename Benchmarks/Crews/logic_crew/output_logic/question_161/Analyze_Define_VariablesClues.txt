1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 3. The houses are sequentially numbered from 1 to 3, where house number 1 is on the left and house number 3 is on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 3 distinct physical locations where individuals reside, denoted as:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3

3. **characteristics**: Each person living in these houses has unique attributes classified into three major categories:
   - **Pets**: The types of pets owned by each person include:
     - Bird
     - Dog
     - Horses
   - **Cars**: The vehicles driven by the residents consist of:
     - Convertible
     - Truck
     - Sedan
   - **Fruits**: The types of fruit each person is eating include:
     - Oranges
     - Mangos
     - Bananas

4. **clues**: The logical statements provided serve to establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:
   - Clue 1: The person who is eating oranges lives in the first house.
   - Clue 2: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.
   - Clue 3: The bird keeper lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating mangos does not live in the third house.
   - Clue 5: The person who owns horses lives in the third house.
   - Clue 6: The person who is eating mangos and the person who drives a convertible live directly next to each other.

From these clues, we can deduce the following arrangement:
- House 1: The person is eating **oranges** (from Clue 1).
- House 2: The person must be eating **mangos** (based on Clue 6 requiring adjacency to the convertible driver and Clue 4, eliminating the third house for mangos).
- House 3: The person owns **horses** (from Clue 5).

Next, analyzing the cars:
- The truck must be in House 2 since it must be directly left of the convertible (per Clue 2).
- Therefore, House 1 (eating oranges) cannot have the truck and must be deduced to have the **sedan**.
- Consequently, House 3 (the horse owner) must then drive the **convertible**.

Assigning:
- House 1: Oranges, Sedan
- House 2: Mangos, Truck
- House 3: Horses, Convertible

Final deductions reveal:
The person driving the truck is in **House 2**.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who drives a truck lives is **2**.
