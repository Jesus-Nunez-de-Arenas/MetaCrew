I now can give a great answer.

To solve the puzzle systematically, I'll analyze clues one by one and derive the necessary relationships:

1. **House Information**: We have 4 houses numbered 1 to 4.
2. **Characters**: 
   - Pets: Horses, Dogs, Cats, Fish
   - Flowers: Tulips, Lilies, Carnations, Daffodils

3. **Clue Breakdown**:
   - **Clue 1**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives directly left of the dog owner.
   - **Clue 2**: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils does not live in the second house.
   - **Clue 3**: There is one house between the person who owns horses and the person who has a carnations arrangement.
   - **Clue 4**: The person with a bouquet of lilies is to the right of the horse owner.
   - **Clue 5**: The cat lover lives in the first house.

4. **Placement Analysis**:
   - From **Clue 5**, House 1 must be the Cat lover.
   - The pet assignments so far: 
     - House 1: Cat lover (no specific pet)

5. **Analyzing Other Houses**:
   - From **Clue 1**, since the tulips owner must be directly left of the dog owner, house 2 must be either the tulips owner or the dog owner. 

6. **Daffodils Position**:
   - Since according to **Clue 2**, the daffodil owner cannot live in House 2, we must assign the other houses strategically. Thus, House 2 cannot have daffodils.

7. **Logical Deductions**:
   - Given the conditions from **Clue 3**, the only configurations that work:
     - If House 1 is Cat lover, then House 2 must be tulip owner, House 3 must be the horse owner, and House 4 must be the dog owner.
     - But then tulips (House 2) has to be directly left of dogs (House 4), making sure no issues arise.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Thus, we form the following based on deduction:
     - House 1: Cat lover
     - House 2: Tulips (unknown)
     - House 3: Horses
     - House 4: Dogs (requires lilies)

9. **Final Assignment Summary**:
   - Given that the only pet option remaining after assessing the natural order:
     - House 1: Cat Lover (no flowers)
     - House 2: Tulips owner
     - House 3: Horses
     - House 4: Dogs

**Final Answer**: The house where the fish enthusiast lives is **house number 2**.
