1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4 (numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4).  
2. **houses**: The houses are entities numbered from 1 to n (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each house contains one person with unique characteristics.  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  
3. **characteristics**: There are several traits assigned to the individuals in the houses:  
   - **drink**: Each person has a different favorite drink: root beer, tea, coffee, or water.  
   - **fruit**: Each person is eating a different kind of fruit: apples, oranges, mangos, or grapes.

   - **car**: Each person has a different kind of car: SUV, truck, minivan, or convertible.  
4. **clues**: The logical statements provided assist in deducing the arrangement of traits among the houses:  
   - Clue 1: The person who drives a truck lives directly left of the person who owns an SUV.  
   - Clue 2: The person who is wearing loafers lives directly left of the person who drives a convertible.  
   - Clue 3: The person who is wearing high heels lives in the third house.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating grapes lives somewhere to the right of the coffee drinker.  
   - Clue 5: The person who is wearing running shoes lives somewhere to the right of the person who ate spaghetti.  
   - Clue 6: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate fried rice.  
   - Clue 7: The person who drives a truck lives somewhere to the right of the tea drinker.  
   - Clue 8: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing running shoes.  
   - Clue 9: The person who is eating apples lives in the first house.  
   - Clue 10: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the coffee drinker.  
   - Clue 11: The root beer lover lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing running shoes.  
   - Clue 12: The person who had pizza and the person who is eating mangos live directly next to each other.    

By analyzing the clues, we can deduce:
- The first house has apples (Clue 9).
- High heels are in the third house (Clue 3).
- Since the truck is left of the SUV (Clue 1) and the truck is right of the tea drinker (Clue 7), we can determine that the tea drinker cannot be in the fourth house.
- As we work through the available clues logically, it leads us to place the tea drinker in house number 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the tea drinker lives is **2**.
