4. **clue(s)**: This variable consists of the logical statements provided to aid in establishing the relationships between the individuals and their attributes. The clues are:

   - Clue 2: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the cat lover.
   - Clue 3: The mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other.

Analyzing the clues:
- From Clue 1, since the person who is wearing running shoes lives to the right of the person eating oranges, and with only two houses, it implies:
  - House 1 must be where the person eating oranges lives, therefore the person wearing running shoes must be in House 2.
  
- From Clue 2, the mystery book reader must be in House 1, being directly left of the cat lover, who must therefore be in House 2.

- From Clue 3, since the mystery book reader and the person who had stew live directly next to each other, and the mystery book reader is in House 1, it means the person who had stew must also be in House 1.

As a result:
- **House 1**: Mystery Book Reader who had Stew.
- **House 2**: Cat Lover who had Fried Rice and is wearing Running Shoes.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who had stew lives is **1**.
