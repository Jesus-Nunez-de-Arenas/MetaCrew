1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is specified as 4. It indicates that there are four distinct living spaces, numbered from 1 (leftmost) to 4 (rightmost).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical entities where individuals reside. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4

3. **characteristics**: This variable includes the distinct attributes of each person living in the houses:
   - **Pets**: Each person has a unique type of pet: one is a cat lover, one is a fish enthusiast, one owns horses, and one is a bird keeper.
   - **Cars**: Each person has a different kind of car: one drives a truck, one drives a minivan, one owns a sedan, and one drives a convertible.
   - **Sports**: Each person plays a different sport: one is a baseball player, one is a golfer, one is a basketball player, and one is a soccer player.

4. **clues**: These are the logical statements that help deduce the arrangement and characteristics of the residents. The clues are:
   - Clue 1: The cat lover does not live in the second house.
   - Clue 2: The bird keeper lives in the third house.
   - Clue 3: The golfer lives somewhere to the left of the person who drives a truck.
   - Clue 4: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 5: The baseball player does not live in the third house.
   - Clue 6: The person who drives a convertible does not live in the third house.
   - Clue 7: The person who owns a sedan lives somewhere to the right of the baseball player.
   - Clue 8: The soccer player lives somewhere to the left of the bird keeper.
   - Clue 9: The fish enthusiast lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

Analyzing the clues step by step:
- From Clue 2, we know that the bird keeper lives in House 3.
- Clue 5 tells us the baseball player does not live in House 3, meaning they must be in either House 1, 2, or 4.
- From Clue 8, since the soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper (House 3), the soccer player must be in House 1 or 2.
- According to Clue 9, the fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player, which implies the fish enthusiast must be in House 1 and the soccer player must be in House 2, since there are only 4 houses.
- With the soccer player in House 2, the baseball player then must be in House 4 (from Clue 7, the sedan owner must be to the right of the baseball player, who cannot be in House 3).
- As we established the bird keeper is in House 3, then the only remaining house (House 4) must have the baseball player.

Now confirming the arrangement:
- House 1: Fish enthusiast
- House 2: Soccer player
- House 3: Bird keeper
- House 4: Baseball player

Combining all elements and applying the sports, cars, and pets characteristics:
- Since the fish enthusiast can only have the pet fish and House 1 correlates to the first house rules, it's clear that additional cross-referencing returns:
- The sedan must then belong to the bird keeper, indicating they drive the sedan in House 3.

Thus, the count of the houses reveals:
The bird keeper lives in **House 3**.

Therefore, the final answer regarding the house number where the bird keeper resides is: **3**.
