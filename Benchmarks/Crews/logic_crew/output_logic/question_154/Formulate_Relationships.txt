Based on the analysis of the clues, the characteristics of each house and their residents have been determined as follows:

| House Number | Pet Type         | Car Type     | Sport Type        |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| 1            | Fish enthusiast    | Minivan      | Soccer player       |
| 2            | Cat lover          | Convertible  | Golfer              |
| 3            | Bird keeper        | Sedan        | Basketball player    |
| 4            | Horse owner        | Truck        | Baseball player      |

**Key Points from the Clues:**
- **Clue 2:** The bird keeper lives in the third house.  
- **Clue 1:** The cat lover does not live in the second house.  
- **Clue 8:** The soccer player lives to the left of the bird keeper (which means the soccer player must be in House 1 or House 2).  
- **Clue 9:** The fish enthusiast lives to the left of the soccer player, leading to placing the fish enthusiast in House 1 and soccer player in House 2.  
- **Clue 3:** The golfer (House 2) must be to the left of the truck driver (House 4).  
- **Clue 7:** The person that owns a sedan (House 3) lives to the right of the baseball player (House 4).  

Through this structured approach, it was confirmed that the bird keeper resides in House 3. Therefore, the number of the house where the bird keeper lives is **3**.
