The person who is a science fiction book fanatic lives in House 1. This conclusion is drawn from the clue that states the person who ate fried rice lives somewhere to the right of the science fiction book fanatic. Given there are only two houses, the science fiction book fanatic must be in House 1 (the left house), and therefore the person who ate fried rice must reside in House 2 (the right house). Hence, House 1 is where the science fiction book fanatic lives.
