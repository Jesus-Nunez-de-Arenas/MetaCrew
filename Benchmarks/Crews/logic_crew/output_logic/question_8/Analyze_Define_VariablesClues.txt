4. **Clue 1**: The bird keeper does not live in the first house.  
   - This rules out House 1 for the resident who keeps birds.

5. **Clue 2**: The mystery book reader lives in the second house.  
   - This establishes a definitive association between the mystery book reader and House 2.

6. **Clue 3**: The bird keeper does not live in the third house.  
   - This rules out House 3 for the resident who keeps birds.

7. **Clue 4**: The history book buff lives directly left of the person who has a bouquet of lilies.  
   - This indicates a sequential relationship where the history book buff must occupy a house immediately adjacent to one that holds lilies.

8. **Clue 5**: The percussionist lives directly left of the person who has a computer.  
   - This suggests a sequential relationship between the percussionist's position and that of the individual with the computer.

   - This rules out House 1 for the resident who owns fish.

10. **Clue 7**: The person who has a gameboy lives directly left of the person who has a rose bouquet.  
    - This establishes a sequential relationship between the gameboy owner and the possessor of the rose bouquet.

11. **Clue 8**: The cellist does not live in the third house.  
    - This restricts House 3 from housing the cellist.

Through careful analysis of these variables and clues, we can decipher the arrangements of the houses, their inhabitants, and the characteristics they possess.

Following through the logic of the clues and process of elimination, the correct arrangement reveals:

- House 1: History book buff, owns horses, plays percussion, has a gameboy, and keeps carnations.
- House 2: Mystery book reader, is a bird keeper, plays flute, and has a computer with lilies.
- House 3: Romance book lover, owns fish, is a cellist, and has a rose bouquet.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who has a gameboy lives is House 1.
