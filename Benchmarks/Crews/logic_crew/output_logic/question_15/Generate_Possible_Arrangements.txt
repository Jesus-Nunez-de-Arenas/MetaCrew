To solve the puzzle involving the two houses, we need to carefully analyze the provided clues and make deductions step by step, culminating in the assignment of characteristics to each house.

### 1. Initial Setup of Houses:
- **House 1**: Unknown characteristics
- **House 2**: Unknown characteristics

### 2. Characteristics Categories:
- **Devices**: Phone, Radio
- **Books**: Mystery, Fantasy
- **Lunches**: Pizza, Spaghetti
- **Colors**: Green, Yellow
- **Pets**: Cat, Fish

### 3. Analyzing the Clues:
1. **Clue 1**: The person who likes green lives directly left of the person who has a radio.
   - This indicates that the green color preference must belong to the person in House 1, with the radio owner in House 2.

2. **Clue 2**: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the first house.
   - Therefore, House 1 features a person who enjoys reading fantasy books.

3. **Clue 3**: The fish enthusiast does not reside in the first house.
   - Thus, the fish enthusiast will live in House 2.

4. **Clue 4**: The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - This indicates that the person who had pizza is also in House 2.

### 4. Deductions from the Clues:
- Since House 1 has a fantasy book reader who enjoys green, that person must have a phone (as the radio is in House 2). 
- Consequently, House 2 will have a person who has the radio, enjoys reading mystery books, ate pizza, and has a fish as a pet.
- Given that House 1 has no fish enthusiast, that means House 1â€™s pet is a cat.

### 5. Final Characteristics Assignment:
- **House 1**: 
   - Color: Green
   - Device: Phone
   - Book: Fantasy
   - Lunch: Spaghetti (since House 2 has pizza)
   - Pet: Cat 

- **House 2**:
   - Color: Yellow
   - Device: Radio
   - Book: Mystery
   - Lunch: Pizza
   - Pet: Fish

### 6. Overview of Assignments:
| House | Color  | Device | Book    | Lunch     | Pet  |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|------|
| 1     | Green  | Phone  | Fantasy  | Spaghetti  | Cat  |
| 2     | Yellow | Radio  | Mystery   | Pizza      | Fish |

After reviewing all clues and assignments, we can conclude that the cat lover resides in **House 1**.

Therefore, the number of the house where the cat lover lives is **1**.
