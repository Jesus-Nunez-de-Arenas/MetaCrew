1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is specified as 3. It indicates the distinct living spaces occupied by individuals, numbered from 1 (leftmost) to 3 (rightmost).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical entities in the problem, representing the locations where individuals live. There are three houses with the following identifiers:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3

3. **characteristics**: This variable encompasses the unique attributes assigned to each occupant of the houses, divided into three categories:
   - **Sport**: Each person plays a different sport:
     - Golfer
     - Basketball Player
     - Soccer Player
   - **Lunch**: The type of lunch each individual had, which consists of:
     - Grilled Cheese
     - Spaghetti
     - Pizza
   - **Flowers**: Different types of flowers in their foyer:
     - Bouquet of Lilies
     - Bouquet of Daffodils
     - Vase of Tulips

4. **clues**: This variable consists of logical statements provided to help establish the relationships and arrangement of individuals within their houses:
   - Clue 1: The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player.
   - Clue 2: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese.
   - Clue 3: The soccer player lives in the third house.
   - Clue 4: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Clue 5: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house.

From the clues, we deduce the following:

- From Clue 3, the soccer player is in House 3.
- From Clue 1, since the golfer must be directly to the left of the basketball player, the only valid arrangement is:
  - The golfer is in House 1, and the basketball player is in House 2.
- From Clue 5, the person with a vase of tulips cannot be in House 3. Therefore, House 3 must have either the lilies or the daffodils, and thus House 1 must have the tulips (since it is the only option left).   
- Based on Clue 2, the person with the bouquet of lilies must be in House 2 (therefore, one can conclude they are also the one who ate grilled cheese).
- According to Clue 4, since the person who ate grilled cheese (House 2) lives left of the one who ate spaghetti, this means House 1 ate pizza since House 3 is taken by the soccer player, who then cannot be the one eating spaghetti.

Thus, we break down the houses as follows:
- **House 1**: Golfer, Pizza, Vase of Tulips
- **House 2**: Basketball Player, Grilled Cheese, Bouquet of Lilies
- **House 3**: Soccer Player, Spaghetti, Bouquet of Daffodils 

Consequently, the individual who consumed grilled cheese resides in **House 2**.
