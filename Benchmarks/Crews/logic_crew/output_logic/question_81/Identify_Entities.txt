The person who ate grilled cheese lives in House 2. 

To elaborate further on the breakdown of clues and their implications:

1. **Clue 1**: The golfer lives directly left of the basketball player. This means in the arrangement, if we denote the houses as H1, H2, H3, the golfer cannot be in the third house since there is no house to their right. Thus the only configuration allowed by this rule could potentially be:
   - Golfer in H1, Basketball Player in H2.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who has a bouquet of lilies lives directly left of the person who ate grilled cheese. This implies that the person with lilies cannot be in the last house (H3), nor can they be the one who ate grilled cheese.

3. **Clue 3**: The soccer player lives in the third house (H3). This is fixed and gives us more structure. 

4. **Clue 4**: The person who ate grilled cheese lives somewhere to the left of the person who ate spaghetti. This supports our understanding that if someone is to the left of another, we will assess this after placing individuals into positions.

5. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips does not live in the third house. This is critical because it indicates H3 must have either the lilies or daffodils. Given that we already set clues for H1 having the Golfer and needing to have something delightful and distinct, H1 must contain the vase of tulips. 

Given the arrangement of the clues, the deductions clarify as follows:
- **House 1 (H1)**: Must house the Golfer, has the Vase of Tulips, and since this is the only place left, they must have eaten Pizza.
- **House 2 (H2)**: Since the only feasible space for the basketball player is here and considering it must also contain the person with lilies, who is directly left of the grilled cheese consumer, this leads to the acceptance that they must have eaten Grilled Cheese and have the Bouquets of Lilies.
- **House 3 (H3)**: This house must contain the Soccer player, who has the Spaghetti and must therefore, house the Daffodils.

Thus, the final arrangement concludes as:
- **House 1**: Golfer, Pizza, Vase of Tulips
- **House 2**: Basketball Player, Grilled Cheese, Bouquet of Lilies
- **House 3**: Soccer Player, Spaghetti, Bouquet of Daffodils 

Thus, the individual who enjoyed grilled cheese is definitively situated in **House 2**.
