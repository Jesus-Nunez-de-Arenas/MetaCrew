1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4 (numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4).  

2. **houses**: The houses are entities numbered from 1 to n (1, 2, 3, and 4). Each house contains one person with unique characteristics.  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  

3. **characteristics**: There are several traits assigned to the individuals in the houses:  
   - **color**: Each person has a favorite color: red, white, green, or yellow.  
   - **drink**: Each person has a favorite drink: water, root beer, tea, or coffee.  
   - **book**: Each person likes a different kind of book: mystery, history, romance, or science fiction.  

4. **clues**: The logical statements provided assist in deducing the arrangement of traits among the houses:  
   - Clue 1: There are two houses between where the person who likes white lives and where the coffee drinker lives.  
   - Clue 2: The coffee drinker lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.  
   - Clue 3: The history book buff does not live in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 4: The romance book lover does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 5: The root beer lover lives in the third house.  
   - Clue 6: The mystery book reader does not live in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 7: The person who likes red lives in the third house.  
   - Clue 8: The romance book lover lives directly left of the history book buff.  
   - Clue 9: The tea drinker does not live in the second house.  

Analyzing the clues step-by-step:
- From Clue 5, the root beer lover lives in House 3. 
- From Clue 7, the person who likes red also lives in House 3 (hence the drink must be root beer).
- Therefore, the only remaining drinks for Houses 1, 2, and 4 are: water, tea, and coffee. 
- Since the romance book lover does not live in House 1 (Clue 4) and the history book buff does not live in House 4 (Clue 3), the only possibilities remaining guide us to deduce the occupants of the houses by elimination.
- By analyzing Clue 1, we need to recognize that Coffee must be in either House 2 or 4, however, since it must be after Green (Clue 2). Finally, we find that the only configuration left matches the clues, placing the Coffee Drinker in House 4.

Thus, the number of the house where the coffee drinker lives is **4**.
