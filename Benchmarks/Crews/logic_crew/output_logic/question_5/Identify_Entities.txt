1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 5. The houses are numbered from 1 to 5, with house number 1 on the left and house number 5 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 5 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4
   - House 5

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Drink**: Each person has a favorite drink which includes:
     - Milk
     - Water
     - Root Beer
     - Tea
     - Coffee
   - **Lunch**: The different meals eaten by the residents are: 
     - Pizza
     - Stew
     - Fried Rice
     - Spaghetti
     - Grilled Cheese

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that help establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:
   - Clue 1: The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - Clue 2: The person who had pizza does not live in the first house.
   - Clue 3: The root beer lover lives directly left of the person who had stew.
   - Clue 4: The person who only drinks water lives in the fifth house.
   - Clue 5: The coffee drinker lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Clue 6: The person who ate spaghetti lives in the third house.
   - Clue 7: The person who had stew and the person who likes milk live directly next to each other.

From analyzing the clues:
1. From **Clue 1**, we establish that the person who ate grilled cheese is in House 5.
2. **Clue 4** states that the person who drinks water is also in House 5. Thus, they must be the same person who had grilled cheese.
3. **Clue 6** confirms that the person who ate spaghetti is in House 3.
4. From **Clue 5**, since the coffee drinker is directly to the left of the person who ate spaghetti (who is in House 3), the coffee drinker must be in House 2.
5. By **Clue 3**, the root beer lover must be in House 1 (as they are to the left of the person who had stew).
6. This means House 1 has the root beer lover, and thus House 2 has the coffee drinker who had stew.
7. The person in House 4 must then be the one who likes milk since they live next to the person who had stew (House 2).
8. The arrangement must then be:
   - House 1: Root Beer Lover
   - House 2: Coffee Drinker (Stew)
   - House 3: (Spaghetti)
   - House 4: Milk Lover (Pizza, inferred since House 5 has grilled cheese)
   - House 5: Water Drinker (Grilled Cheese)

Therefore, the final confirmation of house compositions is:
- House 1: Root Beer Lover (Fried Rice)
- House 2: Coffee Drinker (Stew)
- House 3: Tea Drinker (Spaghetti)
- House 4: Milk Lover (Pizza)
- House 5: Water Drinker (Grilled Cheese)

Thus, the house number of the person who ate grilled cheese is **5**.
