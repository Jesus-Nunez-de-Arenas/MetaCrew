The number of the house where the person who likes green lives is 1. 

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the characteristics for each house:

- **House 1**: 
  - Flowers: (Must have boots or high heels) → High Heels
  - Favorite Color: Green
  - Shoes: High Heels
  - Book Preference: (Must be either romance or history) → Romance (since history is in House 2) 

- **House 2**: 
  - Flowers: Daffodils (from Clue 7)
  - Favorite Color: Yellow (it can't be green or blue)
  - Shoes: (Must be either loafers or boots) → Boots
  - Book Preference: History (from Clue 3)

- **House 3**: 
  - Flowers: Lilies (since that’s the only one left that can’t be in House 2)
  - Favorite Color: Blue (the only remaining color)
  - Shoes: Loafers (from Clue 6)
  - Book Preference: Science Fiction (the only remaining book choice)

So the complete arrangement is:
- **House 1**: High Heels, Green, Romance
- **House 2**: Daffodils, Yellow, Boots, History
- **House 3**: Lilies, Blue, Loafers, Science Fiction

Thus, the person who likes green lives in House 1.
