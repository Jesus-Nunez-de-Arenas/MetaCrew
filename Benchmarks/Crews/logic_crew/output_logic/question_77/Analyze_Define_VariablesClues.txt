1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 2. The houses are numbered from 1 to 2, with house number 1 on the left and house number 2 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 2 houses, each inhabited by one individual, and numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has unique attributes categorized into five distinct groups:  
   - **Drink**: The types of drinks preferred by the residents include:
     - Root Beer
     - Water  
   - **Fruit**: Each person is eating a different type of fruit, specifically:
     - Banana
     - Grapes  
   - **Lunch**: Each individual had a different meal for lunch. The options are:
     - Pizza
     - Stew  
   - **Car**: The types of cars driven by the residents include:
     - Truck
     - Minivan  
   - **Device**: Each individual has a specific device:
     - Radio
     - Computer  

4. **clues**: The following clues establish relationships and characteristics assigned to each house:  
   - Clue 1: The person who has a radio and the person who drives a truck live directly next to each other.  
   - Clue 2: The person who has a radio lives somewhere to the left of the person who had pizza.  
   - Clue 3: The root beer lover does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating grapes lives directly left of the person who has a computer.  

Through careful analysis and deduction using the provided clues, we can determine the following:  

- Since the root beer lover does not live in house 1 (Clue 3), the root beer lover must live in house 2. Thus, the water drinker lives in house 1.  
- Clue 2 specifies the person with the radio lives to the left of the person who had pizza. This implies that the radio owner is in house 1 (and must drink water), while the person with pizza must live in house 2.  
- From Clue 4, the person eating grapes must be in house 1, leaving the person in house 2 to be eating a banana.  
- The only lunch left is stew, so house 1 must have stew, and house 2 has pizza.  
- Now, to satisfy Clue 1 regarding the radio and truck: Since the person in house 1 has a radio (drinks water and eats grapes), the person in house 2 (who had pizza) must drive the truck. As such, the person in house 1 must then have a minivan.

Based on this analysis, we conclude that the person who had pizza lives in house number **2**.
