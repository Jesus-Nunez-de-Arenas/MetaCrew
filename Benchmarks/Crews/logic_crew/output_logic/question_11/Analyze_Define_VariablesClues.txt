1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable indicates the total number of houses involved in the scenario, specified as 4. It identifies the distinct living spaces occupied by individuals and is numbered from 1 (leftmost) to 4 (rightmost).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the physical entities in the problem, representing the locations where individuals live. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4

3. **characteristics**: This variable encompasses the unique attributes assigned to each occupant of the houses, which include:
   - **Books**: The genres of books each person enjoys:
     - History book buff
     - Mystery book reader
     - Fantasy book enthusiast
     - Romance book lover
   - **Sports**: The types of sports played by each individual:
     - Basketball player
     - Golfer
     - Swimmer
     - Baseball player

4. **clues**: This variable consists of the logical statements provided to assist in establishing the relationships and arrangement of individuals within their households. The clues are as follows:
   - Clue 1: The swimmer lives directly left of the romance book lover.
   - Clue 2: The basketball player does not live in the fourth house.
   - Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff.
   - Clue 4: The swimmer does not live in the third house.
   - Clue 5: The golfer lives in the first house.

Utilizing the clues, we can arrange the characteristics:

- From Clue 5, we know:
  - **House 1**: Golfer

- From Clue 2, the basketball player cannot be in House 4.

- From Clue 4, the swimmer cannot be in House 3.

Since the only available house for the golfer is House 1, we can start populating possible houses for other residents:

Assuming:
- House 1: Golfer
- House 2 and House 3 become the only options for the swimmer, who cannot be in House 3 per Clue 4. Therefore, the swimmer must be in House 2, and House 3 will take the romance book lover.

Placing the clues together:
- **House 1**: Golfer
- **House 2**: Swimmer
- **House 3**: Romance book lover
- **House 4**: Must then be the history book buff.

Now applying Clue 3 (the mystery book reader lives directly left of the history book buff), we see:
- Clue 3 must fit the setup of House 2 being the swimmer, which reveals that the only configuration where the mystery reader can fit would thus be:
  - **House 2** must be the Mystery book reader
  - **House 4** holds the History book buff
  
The remaining unsatisfied condition is the basketball player must fit into House 3 now cleared of previous fillers.

To summarize the houses:
- **House 1**: Golfer
- **House 2**: Mystery book reader, Swimmer
- **House 3**: Basketball player, thus making it the confirmed house
  
We see that the basketball player must be living in House **3** as derived from the logical deductions per clues specified.

Thus, the number of the house where the basketball player lives is **3**.
