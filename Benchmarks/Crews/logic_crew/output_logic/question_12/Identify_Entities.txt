The number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is 3. According to the clues provided, we established that House 3 has the mystery book reader. The detailed breakdown is as follows: 
- The person who is wearing high heels does not live in House 2 (Clue 1) and does not live in House 4 (Clue 4), hence they must live in House 1. 
- The mystery book reader lives in House 3 (Clue 3). 
- The history book buff must live in House 4, as known from Clue 2 placing them to the right of the person wearing loafers, who must then reside in House 2. 
- Finally, the person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover (Clue 5), confirming that House 1 has sandals and House 2 has the romance book lover. 

This confirms our arrangement:
- House 1: Sandals
- House 2: Romance
- House 3: Mystery
- House 4: History 

Thus, the mystery book reader lives in House 3.
