1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 4. The houses are numbered from 1 to 4, with house number 1 on the left and house number 4 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 4 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:  
   - House 1  
   - House 2  
   - House 3  
   - House 4  

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Book Preferences**: One person is a mystery book reader, another is a fantasy book enthusiast, another is a romance book lover, and the last one is a history book buff.  
   - **Shoes**: One person is wearing sandals, one is wearing high heels, one is wearing loafers, and one is wearing boots.  

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the second house.  
   - Clue 2: The history book buff lives somewhere to the right of the person who is wearing loafers.  
   - Clue 3: The mystery book reader lives in the third house.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is wearing high heels does not live in the fourth house.  
   - Clue 5: The person who is wearing sandals lives directly left of the romance book lover.  

**Analyzing the clues**:

- From Clue 3, we know the mystery book reader lives in **House 3**.

Following up on Clue 1, since the person in high heels cannot live in House 2 or House 4, the only possible house for them is House 1 or House 3. However, we already established that House 3 is occupied by the mystery book reader.

From Clue 2, the history book buff must be to the right of the person wearing loafers, indicating that the person wearing loafers must live in House 1 or House 2 because history book buffs can't be in House 4 (since House 3 is occupied by the mystery book reader).

If we place House 1 as the wearer of loafers, thereâ€™s a contradiction since then there won't be a place for the romance book lover next to the sandal wearer (as per Clue 5) or the history buff to stick to their positioning.

Hence, the most logical placement is:

- **House 1**: The person with sandals (who also goes directly to the left of the romance book lover).
- **House 2**: The romance book lover (is a result of occupant placement).
- **House 3**: The mystery book reader (fact established from Clue 3).
- **House 4**: The history book buff (as it fits to be to the right of the loafers wearer from Clue 2).

Thus, following logic, we can conclude:
- House 1: Sandals  
- House 2: Romance  
- House 3: Mystery  
- House 4: History  

This leads us directly to answer the question:
The number of the house where the mystery book reader lives is **3**.
