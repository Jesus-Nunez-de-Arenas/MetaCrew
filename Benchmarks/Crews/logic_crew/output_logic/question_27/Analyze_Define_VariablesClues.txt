1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 3. The houses are numbered from 1 to 3, with house number 1 on the left and house number 3 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 3 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Car**: Each person has a different kind of car. The options are:
     - Truck
     - Convertible
     - SUV
   - **Fruit**: Each resident is eating a different kind of fruit. The options are:
     - Banana
     - Mangos
     - Kiwis
   
4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who drives a truck does not live in the third house.  
   - Clue 2: The person who owns an SUV does not live in the third house.  
   - Clue 3: The person who drives a truck does not live in the first house.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating a banana does not live in the second house.  
   - Clue 5: The person who is eating kiwis lives in the first house.  

Using the clues, we can analyze the following:  
- From Clue 5, the person in House 1 is eating kiwis.
- Clue 3 indicates the person who drives the truck must be in House 2, as they cannot be in House 1 or House 3. 
- Since the person in House 2 drives the truck, by Clue 4, the person in House 2 cannot be eating a banana. Therefore, the person who owns the SUV must be in House 3 and must be eating a banana since they cannot be eating kiwis (already confirmed) or mangos.
- Thus, we can assign:
  - House 1: Kiws (thus drives SUV)
  - House 2: Truck (thus eating Mangos)
  - House 3: SUV (thus eating Banana)

By this process of elimination, we find that the person who owns the SUV must live in House 3. 

Thus, the number of the house where the person who owns an SUV lives is **3**.
