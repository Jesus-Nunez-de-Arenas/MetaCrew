The variables in this logic puzzle can be defined as follows:

1. **n**: This variable represents the total number of houses, which in this case is 5 (numbered from 1 to 5).

2. **houses**: This variable refers to the individual living spaces where people reside. The houses are sequentially numbered from 1 to 5 and serve as the primary locations for identifying the residents and their respective characteristics.

4. **clues**: The problem includes 17 specific clues that provide critical information needed to deduce the characteristics associated with each house. These clues restrict the placement of different attributes, guiding the analysis towards a logical solution.

By systematically analyzing these clues and matching them with the characteristics, we can conclude which characteristics correspond to each house, including identifying that the person with a vase of tulips resides in House number 4.

Thus, I can assess the solution according to the patterns formed by the clues provided.

Final conclusion based on the clues leads to:
- The person with a vase of tulips lives in House 4.
