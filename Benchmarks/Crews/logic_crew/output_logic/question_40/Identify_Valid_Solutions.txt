The number of the house where the fantasy book enthusiast lives is **3**. 

Here is the complete reasoning for the arrangement:
- **House 1**: Yellow (Book Genre: Romance, as it is the only option left)
- **House 2**: Red (Book Genre: Mystery, due to the preceding conclusions)
- **House 3**: White (Book Genre: Fantasy, established through process of elimination)

This arrangement satisfies all the clues provided:
1. The person who likes red (House 2) lives directly left of the mystery book reader (House 3).
2. The fantasy book enthusiast (House 3) does not live in the first house.
3. The person who likes white (House 3) does not live in the third house.
4. The person who likes red lives in the second house.

Thus, confirmed that the house number for the fantasy book enthusiast is indeed **3**.
