   - Clue 3: There is one house between where the person who had pizza lives and where the person who had stew lives.
   - Clue 4: The fantasy book enthusiast lives in the second house.

Analyzing the clues:
- From Clue 2, we know that the history book buff lives in **House 1**.
- From Clue 1, the person who had stew must be in **House 3** (one house between House 1 and House 3).
- Clue 3 indicates the person who had pizza must live in **House 2**.
- According to Clue 4, the fantasy book enthusiast lives in **House 2**, which aligns with the fact that only House 2 is available since the history book buff is in House 1 and the person who had stew is in House 3.

Therefore, we conclude:
- **House 1**: History Book Buff
- **House 2**: Fantasy Book Enthusiast (who eats Pizza)
- **House 3**: Person who had Stew (must be the Science Fiction Fanatic due to the other two preferences)

So the number of the house where the history book buff lives is **1**.
