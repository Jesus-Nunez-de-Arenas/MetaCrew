1. Variables in the problem statement:
   - n (number of houses): 3. The houses are numbered from 1 to 3, indicating their left to right order.
   - houses: Three distinct entities numbered 1, 2, and 3, where each has a unique resident with different attributes.
   - characteristics: The three main characteristics to categorize each resident are:
     a. Flowers: One has a rose bouquet, one has a bouquet of daffodils, and one has a vase of tulips.
     b. Favorite drink: One drinks only water, one likes milk, and one loves root beer.
     c. Device: One possesses a computer, one has a television, and one owns a phone.

2. Clues provided:
   - Clue 1: The person who has a bouquet of daffodils lives directly left of the person who has a phone.
   - Clue 2: The person who only drinks water lives in the second house.
   - Clue 3: The root beer lover lives in the first house.
   - Clue 4: The person who has a television does not live in the second house.
   - Clue 5: The person who has a television lives somewhere to the right of the person who has a vase of tulips.

With these definitions, I can analyze the entities further to solve for the house where the person who likes milk lives. From the clues and analysis:
- House 1: Root beer lover, has tulips (based on clues about positions and preferences)
- House 2: Only drinks water, has daffodils (since the daffodil house cannot be on the right of house 1)
- House 3: Likes milk, has a TV (this is the only option left).

Thus, the person who likes milk lives in House 3. 

Final numerical answer: House 3.
