To solve the problem systematically, let's analyze the clues methodically and create a structured representation of the relationships among the houses based on the clues provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **House Setup**: There are 3 houses (1, 2, and 3).
2. **Clue 1**: The tea drinker lives in the third house.  
   - House 3: Tea

3. **Clue 4**: The person who has a carnations arrangement lives in the first house.  
   - House 1: Carnations

4. **Clue 5**: The person who has a vase of tulips lives in the second house.  
   - House 2: Tulips

5. **Current Status**:  
   - House 1: Carnations  
   - House 2: Tulips  
   - House 3: Tea  

6. **Clue 6**: The person who is wearing boots lives directly left of the person who likes green.  
   This means:
   - Boots must be in House 1 or House 2 (cannot be in House 3 because it would not have a 'left' house). 

7. **Clue 7**: The person who is wearing running shoes lives in the first house.  
   - House 1: Running Shoes, Carnations  
   - This implies House 1 cannot have the boots. Thus, the boots must be in House 2, indicating that House 2 likes green.

8. **Updated Status**:  
   - House 1: Running Shoes, Carnations  
   - House 2: Tulips, Boots, Likes Green  
   - House 3: Tea  

9. **Clue 2**: The person who is eating kiwis lives directly left of the person who likes blue.  
   Thus, kiwis must be in House 2 (since House 1 is known) and the blue lover in House 3.
   - House 2: Kiwis

10. **Updated Status**:  
    - House 1: Running Shoes, Carnations  
    - House 2: Tulips, Boots, Likes Green, Kiwis  
    - House 3: Tea, Likes Blue  

11. **Clue 3**: The person who likes milk and the person who is eating apples live directly next to each other.  
    Since House 2 has kiwis, House 1 must have apples.
    - House 1: Apples, Milk

12. **Final Result**:  
    - House 1: Running Shoes, Carnations, Apples, Milk  
    - House 2: Boots, Tulips, Kiwis, Likes Green  
    - House 3: Tea, Likes Blue  

### Final Evaluation:
According to all deductions involving their respective attributes and distributions, it is clear that the person eating apples resides in **House 1**.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who is eating apples lives is **1**.
