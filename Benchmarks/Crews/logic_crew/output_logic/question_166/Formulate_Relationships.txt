I now can give a great answer

To solve the puzzle, we will analyze the clues and establish the relationships between the houses, their respective pets, and flower arrangements:

**Houses**: 1, 2, 3  
**Characteristics**:
- Pets: Dog Owner, Cat Lover, Bird Keeper
- Flowers: Rose Bouquet, Vase of Tulips, Carnations Arrangement

**Clue Analysis**:
1. The person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the right of the bird keeper.  
   This means that the bird keeper cannot be in House 3 (since there would be no house to the right). Therefore, the bird keeper must be in either House 1 or House 2, and the carnations arrangement must be in House 2 or House 3, respectively.

2. The dog owner does not live in the second house.  
   Thus, the dog owner can only be in House 1 or House 3.

3. The person who has a vase of tulips lives somewhere to the right of the dog owner.  
   This means that if the dog owner is in House 1, the tulips must be in House 2 or House 3. If the dog owner is in House 3, there can't be a house to the right, which contradicts the clue.

**Understanding House Assignments**:
- Since the dog owner cannot be in House 2, he must be in House 1.
- This would place the bird keeper in House 2 and the carnations arrangement in House 3 (since it must be to the right of the bird keeper).
- Following clue 3, since the tulips must be to the right of the dog owner (in House 1), and the only place left for tulips is House 2, we conclude that:
  - House 1: Dog Owner, Rose Bouquet
  - House 2: Bird Keeper, Tulips
  - House 3: Cat Lover, Carnations

**Final Relationships**:
| House Number | Pet       | Flower          |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|
| 1            | Dog Owner | Rose Bouquet     |
| 2            | Bird Keeper | Vase of Tulips  |
| 3            | Cat Lover | Carnations       |

**Final Answer**:
The number of the house where the person who has a vase of tulips lives is: 2.
