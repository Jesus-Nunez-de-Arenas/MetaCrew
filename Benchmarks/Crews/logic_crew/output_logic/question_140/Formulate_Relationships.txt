The relationships between the houses and their respective characteristics can be structured as follows:

| House Number | Favorite Drink  | Type of Shoes | Favorite Book Genre         |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|
| 1            | Coffee          | Loafers        | Science Fiction              |
| 2            | Water           | Sandals        | Romance                     |

1. Clue 2 states that the science fiction book fanatic lives in house 1.
2. From Clue 1, since the coffee drinker lives somewhere to the left of the person who is wearing sandals, and with the coffee drinker in house 1 (who must also be the science fiction book fanatic), it confirms that the water drinker must be in house 2 who is wearing sandals.
3. Consequently, the romance book lover, who is not in house 1, must be residing in house 2.

Thus, the number of the house where the romance book lover lives is house number 2.
