1. **n (number of houses)**: This variable indicates the total number of houses, which is specifically 2 in this scenario, numbered as House 1 (left) and House 2 (right). 

2. **houses**: The distinct physical locations where individuals reside are denoted by:
   - House 1
   - House 2

3. **characteristics**: Each person living in these houses has unique attributes classified into three main categories:
   - **Fruit**: The types of fruit they are eating consist of grapes and mangos.
   - **Car**: The types of cars driven by the individuals include a convertible and a minivan.
   - **Sport**: The sports played include cricket and baseball.

4. **clues**: The logical statements provided to assist in deducing the characteristics associated with each house are:
   - Clue 1: The person who is eating grapes does not live in the first house, which indicates they must be in House 2.
   - Clue 2: The baseball player lives in the second house, reinforcing that this is where the person eating grapes resides.
   - Clue 3: The person who drives a convertible also lives in the second house, confirming that both the baseball player and the grape eater reside here.

From the clues, we can deduce that:
- Since the person eating grapes is in House 2 and cannot be in House 1, the only logical conclusion is that the person eating mangos must live in House 1.

Therefore, the number of the house where the person who is eating mangos lives is **1**.
