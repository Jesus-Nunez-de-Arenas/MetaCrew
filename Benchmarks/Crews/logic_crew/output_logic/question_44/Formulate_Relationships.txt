The number of the house where the person who is wearing sandals lives is **2**. 

To elaborate on the reasoning behind this conclusion, I created a structured approach based on the clues provided.

Hereâ€™s a visual representation of the relationships between the houses and their respective characteristics:

| House Number | Lunch         | Musical Instrument | Shoes   | Favorite Color | Car Type |
|--------------|---------------|--------------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| 1            | Spaghetti     | Flutist            | Loafers | Green          | SUV      |
| 2            | Fried Rice    | Cellist            | Sandals | White          | Sedan    |

**Clue Analysis:**
1. From Clue 1, the person who ate fried rice does not live in the first house, so they must live in House 2.
2. From Clue 2, since the owner of the SUV cannot be in House 2, the owner must be in House 1.
3. Given Clue 3, the flutist must live directly left of the person who likes white. Hence, the flutist is in House 1 and the person who likes white (and thus is in House 2).
4. Clue 4 states the person wearing loafers must also be in House 1, which is consistent as they must be directly left of the person who likes white in House 2.

Thus, we conclude that the person who is wearing sandals lives in House 2. Therefore, the final answer confirms that the answer is **2**.
