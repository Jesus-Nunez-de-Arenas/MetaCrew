1. **n**: This represents the total number of houses in the scenario, which is 3. The houses are numbered from 1 to 3, with house number 1 on the left and house number 3 on the right.

2. **houses**: There are 3 houses in total, each having one resident who possesses unique characteristics. The houses are numbered as follows:
   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3

3. **characteristics**: Each resident has different attributes categorized as follows:  
   - **Fruit**: Each resident eats a different kind of fruit. The options are:
     - Apples
     - Kiwis
     - Oranges
   - **Color**: Each resident has a favorite color. The options are:
     - Blue
     - White
     - Green

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:  
   - Clue 1: The person who likes white lives somewhere to the right of the person who likes green.  
   - Clue 2: The person who likes blue lives in the second house.  
   - Clue 3: The person who likes blue lives somewhere to the left of the person who is eating kiwis.  
   - Clue 4: The person who is eating apples lives directly left of the person who is eating oranges.  

Analyzing these clues step-by-step leads to the following deductions:  
- From Clue 2, we know the person who likes blue is in house 2.
- According to Clue 3, since the blue lover is in house 2, he must be left of the person who eats kiwis, so the person with kiwis has to be in house 3.
- From Clue 4, since apples are eaten directly left of oranges, the only configuration for houses is that house 1 has apples and house 3 has kiwis.
- The person in house 1, eating apples, must also be the one who likes green (as house 2 is blue and house 3 is kiwis). Thus, house 2 must have the person who likes white.

Given these placements:
- **House 1**: Eating Apples, Likes Green
- **House 2**: Eating Oranges, Likes Blue
- **House 3**: Eating Kiwis, Likes White

Consequently, the person who likes white lives in **house 3**.

Thus, the number of the house where the person who likes white lives is **3**.
