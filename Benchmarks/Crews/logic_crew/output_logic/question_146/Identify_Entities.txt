According to the clues, we know that there are two houses (1 and 2) and each has a person with different flowers and pets. The critical clue states that the person who has a carnations arrangement lives somewhere to the left of the dog owner. Since there are only two houses, the only way for someone to be "to the left" of another is if the person with the carnations arrangement occupies House 1, while the dog owner must occupy House 2. This arrangement satisfies the condition of the clue, confirming that the person with the carnations arrangement lives in House 1. Therefore, the number of the house where the person who has a carnations arrangement lives is **1**.
