To clarify the characteristics of the two houses based on the provided clues, we can outline the relationships in a structured approach:

| House Number | Flower Arrangement       | Pet Owner     |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| 1            | Carnations arrangement    | Horses        |
| 2            | Tulips                   | Dog Owner     |

1. There are two houses labeled as House 1 (on the left) and House 2 (on the right).

   - House 2 has a vase of tulips.
3. The pet ownership differs as well:
   - House 1's resident owns horses.
   - House 2's resident is the dog owner.
