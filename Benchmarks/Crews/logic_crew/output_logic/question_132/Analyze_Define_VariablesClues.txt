1. **n (number of houses)**: 
   - In this scenario, n equals 3, representing the total number of houses numbered 1, 2, and 3 from left to right.

2. **houses**: 
   - The houses are numbered 1, 2, and 3. Each house contains one person with distinctive characteristics.

3. **characteristics**:
   The characteristics that vary among the individuals living in the houses are as follows:
   - **Musical Instruments**: 
     - One person is a violinist, one is a flutist, and one is a pianist.
   - **Fruits**: 
     - One person is eating kiwis, one is eating grapes, and one is eating oranges.

4. **Clues**: 
   The following clues are provided to help identify the relationships between these characteristics:
   - **Clue 1**: The pianist and the person who is eating kiwis live directly next to each other.
   - **Clue 2**: The flutist lives somewhere to the right of the violinist.
   - **Clue 3**: There is one house between where the person who is eating grapes lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.
   - **Clue 4**: There is one house between where the violinist lives and where the person who is eating kiwis lives.

**Analyzing the clues**:
- From **Clue 2**, since the flutist lives to the right of the violinist, the possible arrangements can be:
  - Violinist in House 1, Flutist in House 2 (thus, Pianist in House 3) or 
  - Violinist in House 2, Flutist in House 3 (no possible placement for the pianist without two instruments in one house, which breaks rule).

- Let's take the first arrangement:
  - House 1: Violinist
  - House 2: Flutist
  - House 3: Pianist
  
- From **Clue 4**, since there is one house between the violinist and the person who is eating kiwis, kiwis cannot be in House 2. Thus, kiwis must be in House 3:
  - House 1: Violinist
  - House 2: Flutist, eating grapes
  - House 3: Pianist, eating kiwis
  
- Since the person in House 2 must be eating grapes (from **Clue 3** regarding the one house between kiwis and grapes), it reaffirms:
  - House 1: Violinist, eating oranges 
  - House 2: Flutist, eating grapes 
  - House 3: Pianist, eating kiwis  

Thus, the number of the house where the pianist lives is: **3**.
