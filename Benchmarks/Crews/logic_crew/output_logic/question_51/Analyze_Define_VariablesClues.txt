   - House 1
   - House 2
   - House 3
   - House 4

     - Soccer
     - Cricket

   - **Lunch**: Each person has a different type of meal. The options include:
     - Pizza
     - Grilled Cheese
     - Stew
     - Fried Rice
     - Spaghetti

4. **clues**: The problem provides a set of clues that establish relationships and positional context among the various characteristics:
   - Clue 1: The tennis player lives in the third house.
   - Clue 2: The person who ate grilled cheese lives in the fifth house.
   - Clue 3: The golfer lives in the fourth house.
   - Clue 4: There is one house between where the person who ate fried rice lives and where the person who ate spaghetti lives.
   - Clue 5: The person who had pizza lives somewhere to the left of the cricketer.
   - Clue 6: The person who had stew lives directly left of the person who ate spaghetti.
   - Clue 7: The tennis player lives somewhere to the left of the soccer player.

**Analysis of Clues:**

- Based on **Clue 1**, the person living in **House 3** is the tennis player.
- Based on **Clue 2**, the person living in **House 5** ate grilled cheese.
- Based on **Clue 3**, the golfer resides in **House 4**.
- From **Clue 4**, since there is one house between the person who ate fried rice and the one who ate spaghetti, if fried rice is in House 1, spaghetti would be in House 3 (but House 3 is taken by the tennis player), so possible placements are:
  - Fried Rice: House 2, Spaghetti: House 4
  - Fried Rice: House 1, Spaghetti: House 3 is not valid.
- From **Clue 5**, the person who had pizza is somewhere left of the cricketer, eliminating House 5 for pizza.
- From **Clue 6**, if stew is directly left of spaghetti, and given House 5 is grilled cheese, the only valid placement is:
  - House 2: Stew, House 3: Spaghetti.
  
By using these deductions, we can logically place the entities:

- **House 1**: 
  - Possible: Pizza or Fried Rice, and unknown sport
- **House 2**: 
  - Stew and unknown sport
- **House 3**: 
  - Tennis (known) and Spaghetti (known)
- **House 4**: 
  - Golfer and unknown lunch
- **House 5**: 
  - Grilled cheese and unknown sport

Now we know:
- The only placement for pizza is in House 1.
- The cricketer must be in House 2 or House 4.

Final deduction from clues:
- The only position for the cricketer that honors all clues must be **House 4** since House 5 is grilled cheese. 

Thus, the number of the house where the cricketer lives is **4**.
